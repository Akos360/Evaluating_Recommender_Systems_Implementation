164,122,0.338,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","A couple of assumptions can be made regarding how ecological factors may determine social marginality and how boundaries in ecological marginality are similar to those in social marginality. We assume that marginalized people often lack access to resources due to unfavorable (geographical) location or generally restrictive local biophysical conditions (Gatzweiler et al. 2011). For instance, remoteness in the sense of living far away from economic centers may result in social marginality by limiting access to work, education, and health care (Leimgruber 2004). From an anthropocentric point of view, ecological systems provide goods and services that their inhabitants use to ensure their well-being. Constraints in resource procurement determine the extent of marginalization. Examples are farming in isolated areas, in areas with limited access to water, or where soils or other conditions are of limited suitability. Complementarily, people may become marginalized as the result of ecological degradation such as desertification, acidification, or salinization of soils, and air or water pollution, etc. In these cases marginalization is the result of a gradual process. Assuming that unfavorable ecological conditions contribute to the general marginality of a human settlement, there may also be privileged individuals who are able to increase their resilience and adaptive capabilities at the expense of less privileged individuals or of common resources. In environments with poor or depleted biophysical assets, forms of social exclusion often manifest (Winchester and White 1988; Gatzweiler et al. 2011). These considerations suggest that it is appropriate to enlarge the scope of analysis over a broader realm in order to understand ecological marginality and the âsocio-ecological systemsâ (SES) concept. It is generally acknowledged that understanding complex phenomena requires insights from multiple scientific disciplines, but not until the 1970s in the context of greater awareness of the global environmental crisis did an appropriate conceptual framework for considering âmingled phenomenaâ emerge (Vayda and McCay 1975). It was during this period that the concepts such as âlifescape,â âlivelihood,â âcoupled human-environmental,â and âhuman-natural systemsâ were first proposed (Howorth 1999; Marschke and Berkes 2006). Recently SES has emerged as a concept integrating human-natural interrelationships that is used to harmonize social development and conservation goals. By asserting that many complex phenomena include both social and ecological systems simultaneously and inseparably (Gallopin 2006), and therefore any demarcation is artificial and arbitrary (Folke 2006), the application of crosscutting and integrated approaches such as the concept of marginality are advocated for the consideration of complex issues. Based on this concept it is worth identifying situations where social marginalization occurs due to ecological variables or ecosystem settings. People can be marginalized due to environmental factors that inhibit their well-being. These factors generally act on distinct spatial and temporal scales due to variation in the physical and chemical characteristics of ecosystems (degraded soils, salinity, toxic pollutants, etc.). All of these factors may be used to describe the degree of marginality to which the inhabitants of an ecosystem are subject. For example, many tropical areas of Africa are affected by sleeping sickness/animal trypanosomiasis, which is transmitted by tsetse flies, making them marginal areas to inhabit and raise cattle: pastoralists who only have access to these areas are marginalized by environmental factors."

In light of the increasing importance of social innovation, this chapter focuses on a conception of social innovation that is grounded in social theory, as a precondition for the development of an integrated theory of socio-technological innovation in which social innovation is more than a mere appendage, side-effect and result of technical innovation. Against this background, social innovation is defined here as a new combination1 or configuration of practices in areas of social action, prompted by certain actors or constellations of actors with the ultimate goal of coping better with needs and problems than is possible by using existing practices (Howaldt and Schwarz, 2010, p. 54). An innovation is, therefore, âsocialâ to the extent that it varies social action and is socially accepted and diffused in society (be it throughout society, through large parts of it or only in certain societal sub-areas). Depending on the circumstances of social change, interests, policies and power, social ideas and successfully implemented social innovations may be transformed and, ultimately, institutionalised as regular social practice, that is, made routine. From this perspective, social innovations can be seen as actions that spread through society as a result of imitation, bringing about social change: a âprocess of change in the social structure of a society in its constitutive institutions, cultural patterns, associated social actions and conscious awarenessâ (Zapf, 2003, p. 427). Only by taking into account the unique properties and specifications of social innovation will it be possible to understand the systemic connection and interdependence of social and technological innovation processes to analyse the relationship between social innovation and social change. This chapter aims to outline how Gabriel Tardeâs social theory can be of benefit in developing a theoretically grounded concept of social innovation and how it can be reinterpreted in terms of practice theory.2 In comparison with action, system and structural theories, this perspective on social innovation is based upon a modified understanding of the âsocialâ as social practices and their reconfiguration as a core element of social innovation (Shove et al., 2012). Practice theories overcome the dichotomies between structure and action, subject and object, rule and application, society and the individual, that arbitrarily define micro and macro levels or sociological âreality rulesâ (Latour and LÃ©pinay, 2010, p. 114). Tarde focuses on social practices as the central theoretical and analytical category and last unit of sociality. The social world is, therefore, composed of specific, although interdependent practices: practices of"
97,169,0.316,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Due to the multiple factors of risk, management in cities and urban regions needs to be based on a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach. A social-ecologicaltechnological systems (SETs) approach (illustrated in Fig. 6.1) can be a useful framework to understand the dynamic interactions between social, ecological, and technical-infrastructural domains of urban systems. The SETs approach aims at overcoming the limitation of a purely socio-technological approach which tends to exclude ecological functions, or of a social-ecological approach inclined to overlook critical roles of technology and infrastructure as fundamental constituents, and drivers of urban system dynamics (McPhearson et al. 2016a). As the SETs approach, can broaden the spectrum of the options available for intervention (Grimm et al. 2016), it is therefore a suitable framework to explore the range of options available and needed to adapt to climate impacts in the urban context. Using this framework, we investigate the pros and cons of adapting to climate change through grey infrastructures (i.e. hard or engineering approaches), âgreenâ and âblueâ approaches (i.e. the restoration of ecosystems, various types of"

Another approach to researching social innovation, exemplified in Chapter 2, is the use of comparative historical case studies. McGowan and Westley introduce a theoretical and methodological framework based on three propositions: first, that new social phenomena create the opportunity for changes to social relations and structures by enabling glimpses into the âadjacent possibleâ; second, that agentsâ behaviour and roles within social innovation can be divided into three categories â poets, debaters and designers â whose efforts are complementary; and finally, that to achieve broad, lasting change, the innovation in question must cross multiple scales â from the niche (micro) level to the (macro) landscape level. The authors explore these frameworks through a case study on the emergence of the intelligence test. This illustrates the three elements within the authorsâ theoretical framework and also shows how social innovation is culturally contingent. The ideas that inspired the development of the intelligence test, such as Social Darwinism, are now widely viewed as profoundly perverse. In 2011, the Centre de recherche sur les innovations sociales (Center for Research on Social Innovations â CRISES) started to build a database of social innovations. In Chapter 3, Bouchard et al. examine the uses and the challenges of building such a database. Since research on social innovation is generally conducted through case studies, it is difficult to carry out macro-sociological analysis of the social transformations that accompany these innovations, and results cannot be generalised. The database of social innovations aims to fill this gap and to enable the longitudinal, sectoral and spatial analysis of social innovation in the context of Quebec. The process of building a database represents an innovative approach to the research of social innovation, and the authors point to a number of methodological, theoretical and epistemological challenges associated with such a task. Part II explores some of the ways in which social innovations reconfigure relations between civil society, the state and the market. Indeed, the boundaries between these sectors are becoming increasingly porous and one of the striking features of social innovations is their ability to combine the traditionally disparate logics of the private, public and civil society sectors. In Chapter 4, Jenson examines some of the varied meanings of the âquasi-conceptâ of social innovation, and argues that one of its major contributions is to provide a novel way to reorganise market relations in the post-neoliberal world. The âwelfare diamondâ is a heuristic device"
72,43,0.303,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Research themes To date, the research literature that focuses on social innovation specifically is limited, albeit growing. A review of this body of work reveals three clusters of research themes. Each is now considered in turn. Innovation in social relations The largest and most well-developed body of work on social innovation specifically focuses on innovation that addresses various dimensions of changes in social relations. This literature can be subdivided into five categories of scholarship: 1. Research Design Challenges: Early work on social innovation developed from within behavioural science with a particular interest in devising âsocial changeâ approaches to tackle key, contemporary social problems, often at a community level (Fairweather, 1967).3 2. Changes in Social Structures: HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen and Heiskala (2007) argued that it is social innovation processes that ultimately determine the economic and social performance of nations, regions, and industrial sectors and organisations: âSocial innovations are changes in the cultural, normative or regulative structures of society which enhance its collective power resources and improve its economic and social performanceâ (2007, p. 59)."

It represents a different model of governance based on a new decisionmaking process where local government and civil society organisations act together with a common strategy. They join efforts and resources with the aim to improve social cohesion in Barcelona. One of the powerful outputs of this program is the creation of several action networks to carry out concrete welfare policies. The chapter will analyse the social processes that allowed the emergence and development of the program, its effects and expectations of future. The integration guidelines in Bern are the subject of a chapter by Maxime Felder. In the second half of the nineties, due to growing heterogeneity and fragmentation of the social and urban structure, and the arrival of new lifestyles (of nationals as well as of migrants), Swiss cities started taking charge of the challenges of migrant integration. In order to overcome an ageing foreigners law and diverse understanding of concepts and procedures, the city of Bern decided to elaborate a concept of guidelines and recommendations regarding integration of migrant populations. A large consultation resulted in a widely publicised document compiling recommendations addressing everyone, and particularly institutional actors. The document was meant to inform the population about the position and aims of the city council regarding integration. This way of discussing, negotiating and writing down guidelines supports participation and acceptance through involvement of stakeholders and acknowledges the limits of traditional welfare governance operating by enforceable rules in a field like integration. The fourth and final part of the book (Part IV) is devoted to crosscutting and conclusive issues. A chapter on the dark side of social innovation by Ola Larsson and Taco Brandsen critically appraises the concept and practice of social innovation. Normative assumptions behind research on social innovation tend to obscure the dark sides of the phenomenon, such as failure, political conflict and oppression. One of the aims of the WILCO project was to identify lessons for social policies and ultimately improve social cohesion. Such an optimistic approach should not, however, prevent us from discussing the more disturbing elements that the researchers identified. The final conclusive chapter of the book by Taco Brandsen, Sandro Cattacin, Adalbert Evers and Annette Zimmer, gives an overview of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly in social innovation. It discusses the implications of the findings, for policymakers and professionals as well as the academic research agenda. âGoodâ signifies what innovations can contribute to a societyâs ability to cope with change and, more precisely, to do it in a way that change can is perceived as progress in civility. âBadâ signifies the shortcomings of social innovationsâ especially their limited impact in an overall averse social and policy context. âUglyâ stands for discourses that deal with social innovations as if they were something elseâusually, treating them like market-based products and technologies. On the basis of the overall evidence on the potential and limits of social innovation discourse, the chapter will give a balanced assessment of the state of the art of social innovation and of social innovation research."

72,75,0.29,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"theory â in terms of its implications and usefulness in the analysis of innovation â has been little explored until now.7 Revisiting Tardeâs social theory â which, at its core, is a sociology of innovation â allows a widening of perspective on the nature of social innovation. This goes beyond the economic and technological innovations noted by Schumpeter (1964) and, after him, by the sociology of technology focused either on the social consequences of technology (Ogburn, 1937) or on the âsocial shaping of technologyâ (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985; Williams and SÃ¶rensen, 2002) or âsocial construction of technological systemsâ (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). At the same time, this new focus reveals the blind spots of a narrow economic view. Because Tarde places the laws of the practices of imitation at the centre of his theory of social development, the associated micro foundations of social phenomena provide vital input into an integrative theory of innovation. It enables a discovery of how social phenomena â conditions and constructs â come into being and how they change. The key to this discovery is to analyse the development of social inventions and innovations as well as the associated social practices of their imitation. Unlike Schumpeter, for whom the innovator â namely the âentrepreneurâ â is the focus of interest, Tarde is concerned with the inventions that are understood to be the central driver of social change. For Tarde, these are the many small inventions and ideas, which were difficult or easy to arrive at and mostly went unnoticed at the time of their arising, which therefore are usually almost exclusively inglorious and nameless. (Tarde, 2009b, p. 26) These countless inventions can change society and its practices through multiple acts of imitation, and only as a result of imitation do these inventions become an innovation and a true social phenomenon: âIn the realm of the social, everything takes place as invention and imitation, with imitation forming the rivers and inventions the mountainsâ (ibid, p. 27). For Tarde, imitation is the central mechanism of social reproduction and of social change: All similarities of social origin that belong to the social world are the fruits of some kind of imitation, be it the imitation of customs or fashions through sympathy or obedience, instruction or education, naÃ¯ve or carefully considered imitation. (ibid, p. 38) According to Tarde, imitations always involve variations and simultaneously bring about innovations in social structures and practices."
72,35,0.283,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"state structures can also drive disruptive social innovation by focussing on reforming democracy and enlarging or deepening citizensâ roles within it. Social innovation can also be defined in terms of the level of its action or impact from the individual to the systems level (micro-, meso- or macrolevel). Such levels or dimensions can be mapped against the two main definitions of social innovation focused either on new social processes or on new social outcomes (see Table I.2). These differing levels of impact point to the complexity of performance measurement on social innovation and emphasise the need for clarity about the unit of impact of a social innovation. Social innovation can also be considered in the context of the more institutionalised fields of social entrepreneurship (Dees, 1998; Nicholls, 2006) and social enterprise (Alter, 2006; Nyssens, 2006). In this setting, social innovation can be seen as the biggest field of"
293,17,0.278,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Dutch context, Schinkel (2010) coincides to note that the very notion of society is problematic, as it implies the existence of a more or less homogeneous and cohesive social environment in which only certain types of peopleânamely migrantsâneed to integrate. Despite being a contested concept, integration continues to be central in many studies and debates on the settlement of newcomers in host societies. In Europe, several authors have attempted to strip the concept of its normative character and build a more open and analytical definition (Hoffmann-Novotny 1973; Esser 1980; Heckmann 1981, 2015; Penninx 1989, 2005; Bommes 2012). Esser (2004, 46) defines integration as âthe inclusion [of individual actors] in already existing social systemsâ. For Heckmann (2006, 18), integration is âa generations lasting process of inclusion and acceptance of migrants in the core institutions, relations and statuses of the receiving societyâ. According to Bommes (2012, 113), âthe problem of migrant assimilation refers to no more (and no less) than the conditions under which they succeed or fail to fulfil the conditions of participation in social systemsâ. In order to work or to gain access to goods, education, rights, and social welfare, Bommes (ibid.) argues, every individual must have some knowledge of what it means to work or how to behave as a patient, a client, a pupil, a student, or an applicant. From this perspective, there is no alternative to integration. Interestingly, all of these approaches have in common the assumption that actors (immigrants in this case) are partially engaged in multiple autonomous and interdependent fields or systems. This implies a shift away from a holistic approach that conceptualizes integration into a taken-for-granted reference populationâthe âcore cultureâ or national society as a wholeâtowards a disaggregated approach that considers not only multiple reference populations but also distinct processes occurring in different domains (Brubaker 2001, 542â544). For instance, Esser (2001, 16) refers to four dimensions: culturation (similar to socialization), placement (position in society), interaction (social relations and networks), and identification (belonging). Similarly, Heckmann and Schnapper (2003) distinguish between structural integration, cultural integration (or acculturation), interactive integration, and identificational integration. From this perspective, integration dynamics and tempos are viewed as different for each dimension, and processes of structural marginalization and inequality become key. In line with these more recent approaches to the concept of integration, this chapter aims to set up an analytical framework for the study of integration processes and policies. For this purpose, we focus in the first part on the concept of integration, introducing an open non-normative analytical definition and identifying the main dimensions, parties involved, levels of analysis, and other relevant factors such as time and generations. In the second part, we define integration policies and propose a distinction between policy frames and concrete policy measures as well as a shift from government to governance in order to account for the complex, multi-layered, and often contradictory character of integration policies. The conclusion returns to the concepts of integration and integration policies and suggests lines for further research."

14,330,0.271,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"moving patterns of connection. Ideas and practices of childhood and ideas and practices of migrancy are not ï¬xed but moving relatively to each other and to other parts of their environments, and this dynamic movement creates and changes the patterns that connect. Although I still do not understand everything Bateson writes, he has certainly contributed strongly to shaping the way I think. His writings have also guided me through some of the more recent, related theories such as critical realism and complexity theory, both of which provide an alternative to conventional social theoretical perspectives (e.g. Morin 2008; Potter and LÃ³pez 2001; Walby 2007). These theorists regard social phenomena as interconnected systems rather than as structures versus agencyâwhatâs more, they argue that social systems are always open, which means that parts of one system will always be interacting with parts of other systems (Danermark et al. 2002; Sayer 2010; Smith 1998). I also ï¬nd relevant their emphasis on the historical embeddedness and âpath dependencyâ of agency, so evident in the variety of ideas and practices of childhood worldwide as well as within national and local communities. So many practices and choices are simply not conceivable in other contexts. For instance, look at Adaâs chapter on âprotectingâ Roma children in Norwayâalthough the Roma do experience and respond to control and oppression in many other national settings, these play out in other, particular ways for particular historical reasons. Adaptation strategies that have worked well in the past may no longer give the intended results, because the present is always different and always changing. Critical realism as well as complexity and dynamic systems theories provide ways of thinking about society that dissolve the structure-agency dichotomy, replacing it with an approach foregrounding the dynamics of practice and process, as immanent in individuals as well as in larger social entities. The issue of whether social phenomena and events should be understood primarily in terms of structure, or primarily in terms of individual agency constitutes an ongoing challenge to the social sciences. While existing literature has tended to favour structural explanations at the expense of agency, or the other way around, I am much more interested in exploring how structure and agency interplay with each other and with power processes. âPureâ structure and âpureâ agency are theoretical constructs that have little resonance with empirical research. If you focus on processes and systems, questions about where structure ends and agency begins just seem like a dead endâ at least to me, they do. Is it not more interesting to explore identity processes as processes, rather than trying to pinpoint whether a young person is part of one or the other static social structure through individual choices? If we regard Czech, or Danish, or Norwegian, or any national society as open and dynamic systems, and the individuals as smaller open systems adapting to and thereby also changing the larger systems, to me that comes much closer to understanding what identity processes are all about. It also shows how influence and power are multi-directional. Even when relationships are clearly power asymmetrical, such as in all the chapters in this book, people donât just sit there and let things happen. Thatâs not how people are and thatâs not how power works."
72,76,0.27,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Added to this are individual initiatives and rebellions against prevailing morals, customs, rules â interruptions or crossings of âimitation streamsâ â that are transferred and imitated from person to person, leading to social innovations. âResearching the âmany small inventionsâ, according to Tarde, is a matter for a sociology which âhas become a truly experimental scienceââ (Balke, 2009, p. 151). Social change must be viewed as a contingent phenomenon that resists any general (macro) theory. Because of the basic interdependence between social structures and social negotiation (Joas, 1992, p. 60), in every reproduced action there exists simultaneously the momentum of creation, change and transformation. The benefit of conceptualising a micro foundation of the social realm consists in decoding the recursive processes based on many small social inventions, ideas, initiatives and innovations as drivers of social change. If social micro units are accorded constitutive importance for the dynamics of society, it becomes possible to describe social change not simply as a trend in the sense of a transition from one state at time t to another at time t1, but to see it as an independent non-deterministic reality. Thus, social innovation can be understood as a âstarting point for creating social dynamics behind technological innovationsâ (Geels, 2006, p. 6), that is, as change that arises as a result of constant changes by inventive and imitating actors (Tarde, 2009c, p. 67). With Tarde, social change can be traced back to the effects of small and micro units. Change is explained from the bottom up in current discourse on social transformation processes, as a fundamental prerequisite for substantial change (Paech, 2012). Its emergence from unintended and intentional deviations from the ideal of imitation provides the possibility of linking micro and macro perspectives (Gilgenmann, 2010, p. 7) â connecting a view of individuals in their society with a view of the society as a whole. While the macro perspective looks at how social facts and constructs impact on social life, that is, it refers to the power of structures, institutions etc. to shape actions (see, for example, Hasse and KrÃ¼cken, 2005, p. 17), the micro perspective on the social realm focuses on the âlaw of their formationâ (Tarde, 2009a, p. 101) and discovers how they emerge and transform, that is, it enables a micro foundation of social change. The key to analysis, therefore, lies in identifying social innovations that spread through society as a result of imitation to bring about social change: a âprocess of change in the social structure of a society in its constitutive institutions, cultural patterns, associated social actions and conscious awarenessâ (Zapf, 2003, p. 427). These are non-teleological and highly contingent processes."
222,86,0.269,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The approach adopted in this research to understanding povertyenvironment linkages is novel in four key ways. First, it takes an integrated, systems approach that considers interactions, feedbacks and trade-offs, which is missing in most analyses (Dempsey and Robertson 2012). Second, the research considers many different epistemic approaches including the consideration of poverty-environment linkages from multiple methodological and theoretical standpoints (Nicholls et al. 2016). Some of these are integrated within the modelling framework, while others provide richness and understanding to the findings. Third, the analysis is future oriented. It is not sufficient to understand present ecological determinants of well-being, without understanding the capacity for these systems or services to continue to generate wellbeing into the future under various political, social-economic and environmental scenarios. Finally, the outcome of the analysis is not an answer to a single question, but rather a process which provides key insights concerning associative and causal linkages that have the potential to untangle and answer a wide range of questions on poverty and the environment (Chap. 28). The research also describes a range of plausible future trajectories derived in a participatory manner. Hence, while the individual components of the analysis are interesting, the integration of these components is ground-breakingâfor example, the integration of social differentiation in rural settlements with biophysical outputs to model poverty through time based on changes in the natural environment."
303,185,0.269,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"four key concepts as its main constitutive pillars. These are âgeographical scales,â âsocial location,â âpower geometry,â and âimagination.â First, according to Pessar and Mahler, genderâa relational conceptâoperates within âgeographical scalesâ that comprise multiple spatial and social scales across transnational spaces. At the same time, gender ideologies and relations are continuously reaffirmed and reconfigured within each constituent âgeographical scale.â âSocial location,â as the second component of this analytical framework, refers to peopleâs positions within interconnected power hierarchies, which are created through various socially stratifying factors such as history, politics, economics, geography, and kinship. Since the hierarchies of each factor operate at various levels and affect the âsocial locationâ of individuals or groups, Pessar and Mahler emphasize that social location is always fluid and not fixed. Certain advantages and disadvantages are conferred according to oneâs âsocial location.â Furthermore, âsocial locationâ determines the types and degrees of agency one can exercise. Pessar and Mahler call this âpower geometry,â which is the third component of their framework. The fourth component is âimagination.â In examining agency, they emphasize that it not only implies peopleâs ability to influence others and their surroundings, but also their cognitive power to initiate change. Suppose that two people are in the same âsocial location.â One might simply be buried, whereas the other might intend to fight back thanks to âimagination.â Focusing on âpower geometryâ makes us aware that it is not only crucial how transnational âgeographical scalesâ are formed; it is also who and what controls their formation that plays the key role in understanding the âsecurityâ and âinsecurityâ of todayâs FODWs. This general understanding draws our attention to multiple-layered migration regimes, which are touched on in the next section. Such layers of legality reflect the intentions of the powerful within todayâs âgeographical scales.â Given that various regimes intend to keep FODWs in their current âsocial positionââinvisibleâit may still be possible for FODWs themselves to transform their âpower geometryâ through âimagination.â Taking âimaginationâ into consideration, the GGP framework suggests that not all FODWs should remain powerless, exploited, and controlled by employers and governments in their host and home countries. It recognizes that their âsocial locationâ can shift. âPower geometryâ is malleable, and some FODWs could someday fulfill the roles of initiators, refiners, and transformers.

72,34,0.268,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Westley and Antadze (2010, p. 2) subsequently expanded upon this by noting that: Social innovation is a complex process of introducing new products, processes or programs that profoundly change the basic routines, resource and authority flows, or beliefs of the social system in which the innovation occurs. Such successful social innovations have durability and broad impact. Second, social innovation can be seen as the answer to social market failures in the provision of vital public goods. This is reflected in the OECDâs definition of social innovation, which also includes a reference to the process dimensions of social innovation (2011, p. 1): Social innovation is distinct from economic innovation because it is not about introducing new types of production or exploiting new markets in itself but is about satisfying new needs not provided by the market (even if markets intervene later) or creating new, more satisfactory ways of insertion in terms of giving people a place and a role in production. In addition to these two meta-definitions, three levels of social innovation can be identified (see Table I.1). First, there is incremental innovation in goods and services to address social need more effectively or efficiently. This is the objective of many successful charities and notfor-profits, as well as some so-called âBottom of the Pyramidâ (Prahalad, 2006) commercial firms. From this perspective, social innovation may simply be a good business opportunity. Second, there is institutional innovation that aims to harness or retool existing social and economic structures to generate new social value and outcomes. Examples such as Fair Trade (Nicholls and Opal, 2005) or mobile banking typically exploit or modify existing market structures to deliver new or additional social value. Finally, disruptive social innovation aims at systems change. This is typically the realm of social movements and self-consciously âpoliticalâ actors, groups and networks aiming to change power relations, alter social hierarchies and reframe issues to the benefit of otherwise disenfranchised groups. Disruptive social innovation can be characterised by structured mass participation in political parties or formal membership schemes of social movements, on the one hand, or loose coalitions of individuals and interests united by an evanescent issue or technology such as social media, on the other. Policy entrepreneurs from within"
72,58,0.266,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Third, there are challenges in scaling up social innovation. The stated objective of much social innovation is to bring about systemic change. However, genuine systems change is a very ambitious objective and typically requires a combination of scale, geographical spread and political support. Bloom and Chatterji (2009) acknowledged these factors when they established the SCALERS model as a guide to key activities needed to achieve scale in social innovation, notably in terms of staffing, communicating, alliance building, lobbying, earnings generation, replicating and stimulating market forces. Elsewhere research has focused on the institutional, rather than organisational, aspects of achieving scale, particularly in terms of building social innovation âecosystemsâ (Bloom and Dees, 2008). However, there is relatively little evidence as yet of social innovation delivering systems change without government support â which begs important questions about the publicâprivate dimensions of scaling social innovation. Fourth, social innovation is often limited by access to market â or even discretionary â commercial finance at the start-up and growth phase (Nicholls, 2010b). There are several reasons for this. First, as was noted above, social innovation often occupies hybrid institutional spaces that span the logics of the state and the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. This creates difficulties in terms of assessing risk and return within conventional financial modelling. Furthermore, given its explicit social focus, social innovation âventuresâ may not aim at maximising their financial bottom line, focusing instead on creating âblended valueâ (Emerson, 2003) that combines social and financial performance. A third challenge is investor exit â there is currently no fully functioning secondary market in which social innovation investments can be realised. The emergence of an impact investing market (OâDonohoe et al., 2010) over recent years may partly address this capital gap â but it seems likely that, going forward, public and philanthropic finance will remain important to develop and grow social innovation. Fifth, there are, as yet, no agreed measurement mechanisms or standard units of analysis for social innovation impact and performance. Welfare economics and the large range of bespoke social impact measurement approaches developed within the not-for-profit or social entrepreneurship sectors offer a set of models that can be used in different contexts, but no dominant standard has emerged (Mulgan, 2010; Ebrahim and Rangan, 2010). As a consequence, exploring the comparative performance of social innovation remains a challenge. This has profound implications for access to capital and policy making."
164,45,0.265,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","In conclusion we ask, what can be expected for whom, from the insights gained under the marginality framework developed here and the analyses done in that context? The answers to this question with the following four assertions are a call for accompanying policy actions with applied and interdisciplinary research for marginality reduction: First, recognizing marginality and marginalized people as complex phenomena leads to equally multi-facetted solutions. At first glance, this appears not to be helpful for focused development policy. However, narrowly focused policies often simply aim to treat the most prominent problem areas independent of social, ecological, and economic contexts, and may not deal with systemic problems. When marginality patterns and causes are identified and assessed in a multi-level (local, national, and global) context, appropriate actions become visible. Once the domains in which marginality may be rooted are identified they can be better addressed, such as: the lack of rights (e.g., ethnic, gender, disabilities), or the entrenched human behavior of people who have been discriminated against for a long time in a certain setting, the lack of access to services or technology, or ill designed macroeconomic policies that adversely impact certain segments of the labor market. This is an added value to income-poverty assessment, which are also most valuable as part of marginality assessment, but are further removed from cause and effect concepts. Second, the marginality framework clarifies the actorsâ and agentsâ potential roles, including the marginalized themselves. Beginning with asking questions like: âwho are the marginalized?â; âwhere do they live?â and âhow and why are they marginalized?â leads to a people and community focus and the institutional setting under which they act. The marginality framework sees social and ecological systems as coupled, and facilitates the identification of the relationships between actors and public infrastructure (physical and social), and how the institutional environment creates structures which lead to processes of marginalization. By implication the framework draws attention to the marginality problem and thereby can facilitate targeting action, not in the sense of targeting a set of poor people, but targeting a set of root causes of marginality, say social exclusion, ecological risks, or deficient institutions."
72,147,0.261,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"often coming from the community sector of the welfare diamond may seek to shape either â and sometimes both â the supply and demand structures of labour markets, increasingly with the support of public authorities. On the supply side, and usually as part of an agenda around social inclusion, social enterprises can work to enable young people, women, immigrants and the long-term unemployed to enter the labour market. Such efforts rely on a variety of legal forms and can be seen as ânew expressions of organized civil societyâ (Vidal, 2005, p. 807). These enterprises can be an instrument for the achievement of the âactivationâ commitment of European social and economic policy (Evers and Guillemard, 2012, Chapter 7). On the demand side, social enterprises â and the social economy more generally â are often tasked with filling gaps in services that do not attract investment by traditional private-sector firms. These new service providers meet growing societal needs and, in the process, create employment. In this context, social innovation can address existing gaps in the market corner of the welfare diamond and, particularly, its failure adequately to provide work, income and inclusion as well as products and services. In these ways, social innovation can also invoke other quasi-concepts, such as social inclusion or social cohesion. Some examples serve to illustrate various perspectives on social and labour market policy. The OECD has long been concerned with promoting higher employment rates but has also increasingly become cognisant of market imperfections (Mahon and McBride, 2008). It has been actively constructing an analysis of how to address social challenges around employment by relying on social innovation (Noya, 2011). Since its 2005 edition, the OECDâs Oslo Manual has recognised a social dimension to innovation. While its Innovation Strategy still primarily focuses on standard approaches and measures of innovation, social innovation has received some attention when âglobal and social challengesâ are raised, while social enterprises have been discussed as an instrument of response to such challenges (OECD, 2010a: 182ff; 2010b: Chapter 5). Deployment of the quasi-concept is, in other words, an alternative way of doing entrepreneurship, management and finance. This can be interpreted as a call for greater interaction across the market and community corners of the welfare diamond â perhaps including a blurring of boundary distinctions. This turn to social innovation is evident in the OECDâs efforts to foster development of labour markets and its analysis of the failure of these markets to provide sufficient well-being for all. An analysis of policy documents and initiatives shows that, while there is a range of ideas about social innovation, one strategy in which the OECD has invested"

Thus, values, beliefs and symbols must be considered in the analysis of social action situations. Referring to our former discussion, one could say that the cultural system is the basis for information flows and communication process in social systems. Like the social system, the cultural system provides comparatively abstract structures that from the perspective of the individual may appear as given. While social structures provide institutions, Parsons calls cultural structures of symbolic signification generalised media of interaction. The prototype and most highly developed example of generalised media of social interaction is language. Parsons argues that social action situations can be seen as (action) systems, in which the personal, the social and the cultural systems are tied together and interpenetrate each other. At a later stage, he added the biological organism as a fourth system. All systems shape action situations by providing orientations (motivations, normative expectations, values, instincts) as well as structures (abilities/resources, rules, media, physical conditions). Social Systems as Communication Situations While Parsons developed his systems theory starting from the analysis of social action situations, the German sociologist and systems thinker Niklas Luhmann (1927â1998) has shifted the perspective to the analysis of the reproduction of social systems (Luhmann 2013). One could say, while Parsons is focussing on the single acts and social organisations at a given point in time, Luhmann is interested in the perpetuation and continuation of social processes in the flow of time. Central to his analysis is the connectivity of events. Rather than to ask how systems shape actions, he asks how systems emerge out of individual acts. Thus, his concern is less about the person that acts but more about the other actors that observe, interpret the act and may react or do not react. Accordingly, the central element of systems is not action but communication."
364,464,0.257,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract The current rate of human development poses a major threat to the ecological balance of the environment, and this is exacerbated by climate change effects. It is therefore important for people to understand the ecology of different locations so they can make informed decisions that will not have an adverse effect on the environment. In this regard, students form a significant group for whom sound ecological thinking is necessary as they will be the future leaders and decision makers who can ensure the worldâs continued sustainability. This chapter presents the results of an ecological education project that successfully expanded studentsâ ecological thinking. Evidence of this change is taken from interview responses before and after the ecological education project. The interview was based on a set of six photographs of different situations found in the environment. Responses were analyzed based on an ecological thinking framework developed by the researchers. This framework consisted of two components: understanding of ecology concepts and understanding of the impacts of human activity on ecosystems. The ecological education project succeeded in increasing studentsâ ecological thinking, thereby increasing their awareness of environmental risks.

72,148,0.255,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"significantly, as part of its concern with the levels and conditions of employment, involves emphasising community-based actions to ensure greater inclusion via local partnerships that innovate in economic governance and employment creation.7 For example, the OECDâs Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) programme has as its mission to contribute to the creation of more and better jobs via innovative policy as well as effective implementation and coordinated strategies.8 In 2000, the programme launched its Forum on Social Innovations, framed explicitly around the notion of improving well-being,9 and developed an officially legitimated definition of social innovation that extended that of the Oslo Manual.10 In this definition, social innovation involves âconceptual, process or product change, organisational change and changes in financing, and new relationships with stakeholders and territoriesâ. The value added by social innovations is that they can, according to the Forum on Social Innovations, both innovate in services and help in âidentifying and implementing new labour market integration processes, new competencies, new jobs, and new forms of participation, as diverse elements that each contribute to improving the position of individuals in the workforceâ. Concretely, this has supported the promotion of social entrepreneurship and social economy organisations, by identifying and celebrating their potential for job creation.11 LEED provides expert teams of advisors to jurisdictions seeking to put such innovations into place. Of course the OECD is not alone in seeing social entrepreneurs and their market behaviour as significant within the wider economy. The European Union has also been moving in this direction particularly since the 2008 economic crisis. The European Union launched its Social Business Initiative (SBI) in 2011 (European Commission, 2011b). Initially, the potential for âsocial businessâ was broadly cast to include all types of firms from multinationals to social enterprises.12 Quickly, however, the SBI narrowed down13 to focus only on social entrepreneurs and their businesses, valued because âsocial enterprises seek to serve the communityâs interest (social, societal, environmental objectives) rather than profit maximisation. They often have an innovative nature, through the goods or services they offer, and through the organisation or production methods they resort to â¦â.14 The promise of social innovations and social enterprise was incorporated into the European Unionâs Europe 2020 strategy.15 Moreover, a series of high-profile interventions have signalled that the European Union shares the views of those who see a greater role for social enterprises in achieving its targets"
222,89,0.255,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Assets, income, nutrition- and blood pressure-related health indicators and subjective well-being vary with location. Waterlogging, high salinity and access are significantly associated with poverty in the study area with different spatial patterns apparent for these three variables (see Chap. 21 and Amoako Johnson et al. 2016). Soil salinity is significantly associated with poverty around the Sundarbans, waterlogging in the centre of the study area, while the lack of access dominates in the east of the study area. For example, the factors associated with asset poverty vary across the study area. Considering all social-ecological systems, the probability of being materially and subjectively poor decreases as household dependence on ecosystem services for income increases. However, the irrigated agricultural zone showed the opposite relationship, with increasing dependence on ecosystem services being associated with a higher probability of being materially poor. Similar spatial and social-ecological system-based differences are found in the health indicators (Chap. 27) and in how individuals perceive their own well-being. Levels of malnourishment are higher than the national average but vary across the study area. For example, food consumption varies across the study area and by social-ecological system. Irrigated agriculture areas show the lowest protein intake and one of the lowest calorie intakes. In comparison, households living in the char and rain-fed agricultural social-ecological systems also have low calorie intake levels, but the protein consumption (from fish) is much higher and child undernutrition lower. This indicates that fish consumption appears crucial to health in some social-ecological system."
278,427,0.255,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"This motivation to improve human development standards comes with significant challenges specific to developing countries, due to limited data availability. The IE community can provide significant assistance to developing countries by simplifying and downsizing data requirements to a point which yields sufficiently accurate results to inform policy. It would indeed be counterproductive if developing countries were to wait for economic growth to fuel complex data gathering operations that can in turn inform their sustainable development policies. Some of the relatively simple metrics developed in IE that can be used to inform specific policies are ratios of different materials to measure resource efficiency. These ratios along with the caveats that need to be kept in mind while incorporating them into policies are in Table 11.2. In addition, IE research has developed frameworks and models that capture the complexity of real systems by integrating several IE-based tools, for example the social-ecological-infrastructural systems (SEIS) framework and LCA analysis in EIPs (Ramaswami et al. 2012; Eckelman and Chertow 2013). An example of the socio-economic metabolism approach is advocated in Chap. 6. The SEIS framework is currently being used to assess environmental impacts of emerging cities in USA, China and India (Ramaswami et al. 2015). A similar framework is the Integrative Regional Action Planning (IRAP) framework that integrates planning across undeveloped land, rural and urban regions (Jaderi et al. 2014; Van ZeijlRozema and Martens 2011; Huynen et al. 2004; Lowe 2006). Such integrative frameworks call for cooperation between various stakeholders and institutions for a comprehensive understanding of regions, their impacts and solutions. These inte-"
376,443,0.25,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","SESs are typically too large and complex to analyze all their structural and functional components at once. Creating a conceptual framework is one way of thinking through the complexity of SESs. The primary purpose of SES frameworks is the identification of specific components, processes, or feedbacks for analysis, and a metric for assessing their roles and interactions in the system. For example, who are the resource uses, and do they share information about the resource with each other? How far is a population from where policy and management decisions are made, and how valued is their input about resource use? Policy makers or resource managers can create their own frameworks in order to analyze their resource systems of interest. The key is identifying the important variables, the scales on which they operate, figuring out how they interact, and then measuring them over time. When problems arise, trying to solve the âwhyâ will often entail finding unexpected connections between multiple components within the SES. Understanding how the SES has reacted to perturbations in the past can be of great help in this effort. At best, the use of SES frameworks will spotlight where interventions are needed or possible to achieve management goals, and will detect system changes over time in a way that allows for some level of prediction. One SES framework originating from political and economic science is meant to allow identification of SES components and interactions within systems of resource use such as fish, groundwater, or pastures. This framework divides an SES into seven categories for analysis: resource systems, resource units, governance, users, interactions, outcomes, and related (or adjacent) ecosystems (Ostrom 2007, 2009). Each of the seven categories is then subdivided into a set of components in order to identify causal relationships and drivers, so that different systems can be compared. A different framework focuses on the exposure of an SES to a particular hazard, and then tracks sensitivity and resilience of both social and ecological components with the aim of analyzing vulnerability (Turner et al. 2003). A third, called the Drylands Development Paradigm, aims to synthesize lessons from research on desertification and economic development, and to act as a template whereby each of the five key principles of SESs can be examined and tested in case studies (Reynolds et al. 2007). The Resilience Alliance has created its own framework specifically for assessing the resilience of an SES (Resilience Alliance). Each of these frameworks is intended for a specific set of contexts and types of resource use, but the underlying assumptions about the interdependency of SESs are the same (for a review of ten SES frameworks, see Binder et al. 2013). Researchers and managers tend to focus on the components of an SES most likely to be influenced by a given change or intervention, or perhaps those most amenable to analysis or management based on their own discipline, as the methods and theories of their own discipline are most familiar to them. Team approaches that include social as well as ecological scientists can help to assure a more comprehensive approach. Three key characteristics critical for analyzing an SESâscale, feedback, and resilienceâmay be difficult to recognize and measure, and thus may be overlooked. A rangeland SES is profoundly affected by attributes such as the"

This analysis would lead to a more in-depth understanding of the characteristics of this model, including its evolution over time, as well as the effects of social innovations on social transformation. Social innovation could even be examined with regard to its possible capacity to influence or transform the development model itself (Lipietz, 1989), and conversely, the effects of such a modified model on social innovation. It would also be possible to study regional innovation systems in the context of smaller territories or sector-based innovation systems (LÃ©vesque, 2011). There are many other possible lines of research that could be addressed by the CRISES Database on Social Innovation, including: â¢ To what extent does the state-institutional framework (public policy, governance schemes, etc.) influence the means â collective action and social innovations â used by organisations to respond to civil societyâs needs and aspirations? An answer to this question might be found in the analysis, for a given territorial context, of the relationships between the legal and regulatory framework in which organisations operate; the public policies and government programmes that apply to organisations; and the factors of emergence of social innovations, in particular the needs and aspirations leading to collective action. â¢ How does geographic proximity influence the development of social innovation clusters and which sectors of activity are the most conducive to the development of such clusters? â¢ To what extent do the different types of interactions between organisations have an influence on the development of certain types of social innovation? This pertains to the question of networking between organisations, and a network analysis calls for a spatiotemporal analysis of data. More concretely, the composition and structure of networks, as manifested in interactions, can be studied by means of visualisations and associated analytical methods. In fact, graphs are the most widely used theoretical tool for modelling and identification of properties of structured sets (Beauquier et al., 1992). They are essential to anyone wishing to study and represent a set of links between elements of a finite set of objects (Xuong, 1992). In the CRISES Database on Social Innovations, a detailed analysis of networks of organisations will be realised on the basis of spatiotemporal measurements of the density, eccentricity and centrality of"

Ecological thinking involves understanding concepts in ecology including biotic factors, abiotic factors, and biotic interaction. It is complemented by understanding the impact of human activity on ecosystems. Ecological thinking can be improved through ecological education. Improvement of ecological thinking, and understanding the impact of human activity on ecosystems, will eventually lead to increased awareness regarding environmental risk. An ecological education project was therefore conducted with secondary school students as subjects to effect an improvement in their ecological thinking."

We might nonetheless claim that Cacioppo and Berntson set the stage for a contemporary research landscape that â at least in certain corners â is attending carefully to the ways in which social adversity is a causal factor in mental disorder (European Network of National Networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions in Schizophrenia (EU-GEI) et al. 2014; Hyman 2009), in which the sociopolitics of stress and trauma are situated in accounts of specific psychopathologies (Galea 2011), in which specific brain regions are situated vis-Ã -vis the role they play in human social interaction (Amodio and Frith 2006), and so on. From the other direction, a range of positions in social theory have radically undercut the traditional scepticism that the social sciences (at least the qualitative social sciences) have displayed toward not only biological explanations â but any admixture of the biological and social per se. In his account of what might become of âThe Human Sciences in a Biological Ageâ, sociologist Nikolas Rose points out that, âNo longer are social theories thought progressive by virtue of their distance from the biological. Indeed the reverse assumption is common â it seems that âconstructivismâ is passÃ©, the linguistic turn has reached a dead end and a rhetoric of materiality is almost obligatoryâ (Rose 2013, 4). While retaining some critical distance from these obligations, Rose nonetheless casts a future for the social sciences in which an attention to vitality (understood not only as a philosophical commitment, but as a deep, abiding and collaborative attention to the biological stakes of human life) returns to the centre of the sociological enterprise. Similar claims have been made across a range of contemporary social theories (e.g. Braidotti 2010; Greco 2005; Grosz 2004). In our own efforts to think with and through bodies, we have been especially moved by arguments emerging from feminist science studies, and from that literature sometimes inadequately gathered together under the rubric of a âmaterial feminismâ â which has, at least since Donna Haraway first drew attention to the theoretical potency of the body positioned scientifically (Haraway 1985), pioneered such approaches. Put very broadly, a âmaterial feminismâ moves beyond an insistence on the construction of gendered bodies to ask whether feminist theory might, rather, seek resources in the materiality of the body, and in the thinking of the sciences that labour to bring that materiality into understanding. It describes a move of feminist theory beyond the âtextual, linguistic and discursiveâ, to refocus on the pains and pleasures of embodiment: âwe need a way to talk about these"

SES frameworks are built around the analysis of action situations similar to those defined by Parsons (Sect. 4.3.3). They have been developed in order âto clarify the structure of an SES so we understand the niche involved and how a particular solution may help to improve outcomes or make them worse.

72,72,0.239,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"certain observations were available; but it is not an inherent part of the theory (Ogburn, 1969, p. 139).5 Yet, these aspects of Ogburnâs theory â that could have formed the basis for a comprehensive theory of innovation â remained largely ignored in a wider theoretical context in which there was a one-sided focus on the relevance of technology for social change (Freeman, 1974; OECD, 1997). Only in recent years has a new understanding of the innovation process become more important, in which openness towards society is central (FORA, 2010, p. 15 ff.). Individual aspects of this development are reflected in terms and concepts such as âopen innovationâ, âcustomer and user integrationâ, â(innovation) networksâ, âmulti-stakeholder dialoguesâ and âthe new power of the citizenryâ (Marg et al., 2013). The development of ârobust design conceptsâ (Gross et al., 2005) and institutions that combine research and innovation with âpost-conventional forms of participationâ (Marg et al., 2013, p. 8) are explicitly the subject matter of, for example, transition management, transdisciplinary sustainability research, governance research and, particularly, network research (for example, Powell and Grodal, 2005). Thus, at the same time, social innovation has started to be seen as a type of innovation that is distinguishable from technological innovation with its own subject area, sphere of influence and field of application (Howaldt and Schwarz, 2010). However, it is not possible to define social innovations solely by referring to a distinct social sphere or to socially desirable outcomes as their key purpose (Rammert, 2010, p. 40). Rather, what is at issue is the substantive core of the innovation. With social innovations, the new does not manifest itself in the medium of technological artefacts, but at the level of social practices. If it is accepted that the invention and diffusion of the steam engine, the computer or the smartphone should be regarded differently from the invention and social spread of a national system of healthcare provision, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or a system of micro lending, then it stands to reason that there is an intrinsic difference between technological and social innovations. While it is true that all innovations, regardless of their object, can be viewed as a social phenomenon, this does not obviate the need empirically to research the commonalities and differences between these two types of innovation. Even if, in reality, both types closely connect with each other in socio-technological systems, the need for analytical distinction does not disappear. This is all the more urgent given that existing sociological innovation research, that has emanated"
278,225,0.238,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"The concept of socio-economic metabolism is relatively young in the literature. Here we interpret the term in an inclusive sense that is synonymous with social (Fischer-Kowalski 1998; Fischer-Kowalski and Weisz 1999), industrial (Ayres 1989) and anthropogenic metabolism (Baccini and Brunner 1991). Modelling methods that incorporate anthropogenic stocks and ï¬ows can trace their lineage back to the early works of Forrester (1958), but examples where social metabolism and material and energy ï¬ow accounting are united with dynamic stock analysis are rare (Baccini and Bader 1996; MÃ¼ller et al. 2004; Lennox et al. 2005; MÃ¼ller 2006; Baynes et al. 2009; MÃ¼ller et al. 2013; Pauliuk and MÃ¼ller 2014). Even within that handful, few talk of the services from stocks that are germane to our discussion on sustainable development. There are a number of proponents of this integrated thinking and there is a natural application in urban systems. The âSocial-Ecological-Infrastructural Systems Frameworkâ of Ramaswami et al. (2012) begins with questions of urban sustainability and expands to the same scope as the socio-economic metabolism framework. They speciï¬cally include services from internal and âtrans-boundaryâ infrastructures, but the key difference from the socio-economic metabolism framework lies in the dynamic treatment of stocks in-use in the latter. In the following sections, we discuss key features of the socio-economic metabolism framework (hereafter the âmetabolic frameworkâ or approach) â see Fig. 6.2."

Social norms are the accepted or implied rules about how members of a social group should, and do, behave (Sherif 1936). Individuals breaking these rules may be sanctioned formally, if the norm is written into law for example, or informally through social disapproval. The more motivated an individual is to identify with a particular social group, the more likely they are to recognize and conform to the groupâs norms (Deaux 1996; Manfredo 2008), particularly if the norm is central to group identification (Christensen et al. 2004).

The phenomenon, which involves combining resources in new ways to create social value, is increasingly popular, gaining attention from both academia and practice (Kupolokun 2014). Although the term âsocial entrepreneurshipâ and its current meaning are relatively new, the phenomenon as a practice is not.

256,371,0.236,"Supercomputing Frontiers : 4Th Asian Conference, Scfa 2018, Singapore, March 26-29, 2018, Proceedings","Study from DARPA [2] and Top Ten Exascale Research Challenges from DOE [12] have identified power consumption as one of the major constraints in scaling the performance of HPC systems. In order to bridge the gap between required and current power/energy efficiency, one of the most important research issues is developing a power management framework which allows power to be more efficiently consumed and distributed. Power management is a complicated process involving the collection and analysis of statistics from both hardware and software, power allocation and control by available power-knobs, code instrumentation/optimization, and so on. For large scale HPC systems, it would be more complex since handling these tasks at scale is not easy. So far, these tasks are mostly carried out in a discrete and hand-tuned way for a specific hardware or software component. This fact causes several problems and limitations. First, the lack of cooperation/automation makes power management very difficult and time-consuming. It is desirable that power management process is able to be carried out under a common convention with little effort from users and system administrators. Second, though there are many existing tools to be potentially used for power optimization, each of them is usually designed for different purpose. For example, PDT and TAU are used for application analysis, RAPL is dedicated to power monitoring and capping while cpufreq targets mainly for performance/power tuning [10,18,23]. It is necessary to have a holistic way to use them together. Third, different HPC systems have different capabilities for power management, resulting in system or hardware-specific ad-hoc solutions. Of course, these are not portable. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a generalized interface for portability and extensibility. Fourth, power management sometimes needs a collaborative effort from both users and administrators. Many existing solutions fail to draw a clear border between them. To address these problems, some of power management related tools and APIs such as GeoPM [5] and PowerAPI [8] have been developed. These tools/APIs are user-centric and need hand-tuning efforts for efficient power management. Hence, we design and implement a versatile power management framework targeting at power constrained large scale HPC systems. We try to provide a standard utility to people of different roles when managing/using such systems. Through this framework, we provide an extensible hardware/software interface between existing/future power-knobs and related tools/APIs so that system administrators can help supercomputer users make full use of valuable power budget. Since the framework defines clear roles for people participating and software components, power management and control can be carried out securely. The framework contains a very simple domain-specific language (DSL) which serves as a front-end to many other utilities and tools. This enables users to create, automate, port and re-use power management solutions. This paper makes the following contributions: â We design and implement a versatile framework to meet the necessity of performance optimization and power management for power-constrained large scale HPC systems."

To identify and explore the barriers and bridges to that integration, a range of social and systems sciences were applied to examine the effectiveness of ârepublican,â e.g., national, based on the French system, and traditional forms of governance and the potential to harmonize them. In addition, exercises in scenario development allowed managers and planners to explore potential paths of policy development. Finally, conceptual modeling afforded a systems analysis of the ecological, economic, and social factors that can individually or by interaction create opportunities or barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries management. The results were used to make recommendations for ï¬sh and water policies, in education (universities and governmental agricultural professional schools), and will have practical relevance for food security and health care (Melcher et al. 2013; Ouedraogo et al. 2014; Sendzimir et al. 2015). This chapter pursues the central question of the SUSFISH project, e.g., what is the long-term potential to establish sustainable ï¬sheries and aquatic ecosystems on which they depend in BF? SUSFISH embraced this question as a challenge wider than simply transferring the technical means to monitor ï¬sheries but in instilling and awakening a culture of healthy ï¬sheries that is broadly supported across Burkinabe society as well as in government policy. We begin by describing the scientiï¬c advances that the project used in application to establish bioindicators and monitoring methods as the technical base of ï¬sheries management.

This work was echoed in the activities of the Netherlands Centre for Social Innovation 30 years later (see Pot and Vaas, 2008). 4. Diffusion of Social Change: From within sociology, there are analyses of the micro-level structures of innovation and diffusion that affect society â for example, how medical innovations spread across groups of clinicians â that have been classed as social innovation. Henderson (1993) was interested in the relationship between social innovation and political change in terms of diffusion processes. He explored how citizen movements catalyse social innovation â conceptualised as distinct from dominant cultural norms â from fluid positions outside of conventional societal structures. 5. Urban Studies: There is a significant cluster of work within urban studies exploring innovative responses to social exclusion as social innovation under the heading of Integrated Area Development. Much of this work centres on innovation within social relations in urban contexts, and as a body of work, it explores the potential of public, private and civil society models, interventions and interactions.

The GoNERI program included various tasks for the purpose of developing an advanced nuclear engineering curriculum. Among them, the task of âintegrationâ was given the highest priority. An official statement of the GoNERI program framed this attempt as âthe first systematic education on nuclear energy in the world â¦ incorporating the social, liberal arts and technical subjects as they relate to nuclear utilization.â [3] The UTNEM professors were aware that the faculty and students of UTNEM in many cases did not yet have sufficient command of the fundamentals of the social sciences (their domain, concepts, terminology, methodology, etc.), and that this separated them from social scientific activities even at the time when GoNERI started in 2007 and limited them in collaborating with social scientists and citizens.

However such projects raise ethical issues and public concerns that can impede their developments, as illustrated by the failure of the Swiss Etiological Study of Adjustment and Mental Health (SESAM) (Kummer 2011). Next to challenges associated with work in interdisciplinary teams that bring together social and biological scientists, statistical expertise is required to analyse longitudinal data, adding another layer of complexity. Important questions arise around the empirical analysis of the theoretical models. In this volume, Bell and Jones underline the perils of modelling age, period and cohort effects and propose a theory driven approach to conceptualise these effects. In a chapter combining a methodological discussion and empirical results, Hoekstra and Twisk compare the contributions of latent class growth models and mixed models to the analysis of health trajectories. Ghisletta et al. also examine the advantages and limitations of different statistical models, namely linear mixed-effects models and structural equation models. While life course epidemiology remains centred on the analysis of quantitative data, we consider that qualitative data are also needed to improve our understanding of health trajectories. Meanings associated with transitions and social hierarchies, expectations of successive cohorts of elderly people ageing in better health conditions are important elements in the complex experience of health. As initiated with work on lay views on health inequalities (Davidson et al. 2006; Popay et al. 1998), data from in-depth individual or collective interviews can inform on mechanisms that relate social and physiological aspects of individual life courses. Qualitative data collected with people suffering from specific conditions are needed to understand their trajectories and their interpretations of biological and social vulnerability."
278,366,0.229,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"The social and solidarity economy finds its roots in the social economy, which emerged in the early period of Western industrialization, in the nineteenth century, when poverty in urban centres was a central concern. The Welsh social reformer Robert Owen founded the cooperative movement at this time, and cooperatives and associations became âthe first line of defenceâ in rallying to address social ails (Lewis 1997 in Laville 2011). The social economy was relegated to the status of a âthird sectorâ in the post-war period, when the market economy was seen as responsible for regulating property and currencies, and where the welfare state was considered the primary vector for social action through the redistribution of wealth (Laville 1994). The social economy cast in this role of a âthird sectorâ represented all other forms of organization, including non-profit and non-governmental activities. Neoliberal policies, recurring financial crises, as well as the failure of the welfare state to address social issues, all contributed to a rebirth of the social economy in the 1990s. As inequalities widened and environmental issues expanded to a local and global scale, the âsustainable developmentâ paradigm was brought into question in what has been called a âcrisis of valuesâ, leading to a renewed interest in the social economy (Laville and Cattani 2006). Almost 10 years after the first Earth Summit, the participants at the first World Social Forum in 2001 (Porto Alegre, Brazil) rallied around the phrase âAnother world is possibleâ; the social economy was seen as playing a prominent role in this new world order. For some, the notion of the âsocial economyâ was insufficient, as this term was too closely associated with the third sector at that time. Arguments were put forward to challenge a definition of the social economy solely based on the type of entity or legal status.2 From this effort, the term âcivil and solidarity economyâ was coined to account for numerous other initiatives that had emerged, particularly in Europe, that were neither non-for-profit nor non-governmental (Laville 2011). Private enterprises, for example, can be built on social values and have their place in what came to be known as the âsocial and solidarity economyâ (SSE), primarily in French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguesespeaking countries, in Europe and in the Americas. As Fraisse (2003) rightly notes, the SSE is being interpreted in different ways around the world. In the United States, members of the SSE aim towards the sys2"

222,87,0.228,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This research dynamically analyses the two most important ecosystem services in terms of livelihoods in the delta: agriculture (including aquaculture where appropriate Chap. 24) and fisheries (focusing on offshore capture fisheries Chap. 25) under future environmental change and management scenarios. The area and species distribution of the Sundarbans mangrove forest are also modelled with a preliminary assessment of ecosystem services including protection against storm surges (Chap. 26). These three key provisioning services were operationalised using seven social-ecological systems, defined as freshwater and brackish aquaculture, irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture, riverine and char environments, the coastal zone and the Sundarbans dependent zone (see Chap. 22, Adams et al. 2013, 2016). The social-ecological system classification recognises that although in certain regions a specific type of service may dominate livelihoods, households usually have more than one type of income source and that these sources may change through the year depending on the character of the ecosystem (Raudsepp-Hearne et al. 2010). Households select different ecosystem services from within the bundle at different times of the year. Social-ecological systems are thus the result of human activities to mediate the negative impacts of environmental variability and to manage bundles of ecosystem services (MartÃ­n-LÃ³pez et al. 2012). Social systems dictate the rules of access to resources and influence the winners and losers of trade-offs between different benefits (Walker et al. 2004), ultimately affecting the relationship between ecosystem service dependence and poverty outcomes. The relationship between ecosystem services and poverty changes because social mechanisms and other factors co-vary with bundles of ecosystem services. For example, the presence of opportunities for supplementing incomes with open access resources (e.g. fisheries, forest products), land ownership, opportunities for sharecropping and leasing land, agricultural labour, access to off-farm income opportunities, the level of exposure to extreme events, the impacts of cyclones and storm"

It contributes to encouraging and supporting such new market actors via actions such as the 2014 conference on âEmpowering social entrepreneurs for innovation, inclusive growth and jobsâ. At that event, workshops focused on the âpotential of social enterprises for job creation and green economyâ as well as on the ways that the European Union could use its structural funds to support and foster social enterprises.16 Leverage for jobs, social inclusion and green initiatives were all identified as necessary because they are inadequately addressed by traditional firms. Nor is it only international or supranational organisations that engage in behaviour meant to structure labour markets, both on the supply and demand sides. The major cross-national study of social cohesion and innovation reported in Evers et al. (2014) documented that âwork integration enterprisesâ were the most common innovation in local welfare systems. These kinds of businesses exist at the blurry boundary between market and community, often difficult to distinguish from the kinds of community groups, third-sector providers and associations that engage in social development projects, frequently at the local level (Moulaert et al., 2010). Social policy communitiesâ enthusiasm for the market participation of social entrepreneurs and the social economy has had to go beyond cheer-leading and publicising best practices, of course. The reconfiguration of the welfare diamond has necessitated attention to how social innovations will be financed. This need has resulted in blurring of boundaries between public and private governance as public funds flow into the market corner of the welfare diamond to finance, in whole or in part, services that are no longer public services in the classic meaning of the term, that is provided by public employees at no cost (or little cost) to users. âMany if not most of the SIs [social innovations] we dealt with rely on a multiplicity of resources and their combination; the mix may vary and state financing may often be the most important component, but in most cases there is a degree of (financial) co-responsibility of other organizations from the civil society or the business sectorâ (Evers et al., 2014, p. 22). In other words, local, regional, national or European public authorities were actively using their available funds to foster local innovations in labour markets and for services. They were engaged in market-making and in blurring traditional boundaries between public and other forms of services. Developments in childcare services provide another good example of this blurring, which has intensified as the âsocial investment"
72,183,0.227,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Germany (Evers et al., 2014, p. 137). This is an example of one of many municipalities in Germany that had opted for local responsibility rather than being part of an integrated centralised service system. Upgrading the community component in mixed welfare systems Given that the community sphere was often subsumed within the third sector of voluntary associations in society, excluding family relationships and informal neighbourhood-communities, it was all the more important to see that a major aspect of many social innovations was developing innovative forms of community. A good example of combining the public and community spheres and sharing the responsibility for care between these two was the âChildren CafÃ©sâ in Lille, France, which opened up the tasks and concerns of family life to the community. Another example was from Amsterdam (the Netherlands), where a housing corporation decided to support community organisations (âNeighbourhood Management Companiesâ) in their housing as it was being reconstructed (Evers et al., 2014, p. 80; p. 203). It should certainly be noted that many social innovations were, in various ways, challenging traditional interpretations of welfare, in which community, building on a shared sense of duty, was seen as a rather parochial element to be gradually substituted by more state-public, professionalised and completely voluntary elements. Integrating economic and social logics In contrast to the previous point, the integration of social and economic logics is much better established as a concern in the debates on the profile of future welfare systems. The creeping economisation of all spheres of life, and an increasingly productivist attitude that evaluates all social actions and relationships primarily with respect to their quantifiable economic effect, is just one side of the coin. The other side can be found in the debate on the welfare state as a âsocial investment stateâ (Morel et al., 2012) that advocates modernising public welfare through an approach that stresses the positive economic effects of social policy interventions in education, family support, and occupational and social integration. In urban regeneration, those social innovations that sought to combine the active participation of people as co-producers and co-decision-makers with public and private investment could be seen as part of this perspective on social investment as a means of societal development. Integrating welfare and urban politics Policy fields that are usually excluded from the welfare system, such as environmental policy or cultural activities, played an important role in"
273,148,0.227,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"these aspects must be adequately considered and the indicators of various factors should be rationally determined and distributed, so as to form a structurally complete, logically strict and rationally distributed indicator system; in this way, the evaluation system can comprehensively and precisely reflect the real status of global environmental competitiveness. 2. The GEC factors are mutually influential and interactive. The ecological, biotic and resource environment under the context of global environmental competitiveness are always mutually influential and interactive in between. Changes in ecological environment will influence biotic and resource environment, while changes in the latter will also influence the former. For example, expansion of natural reserve area (corresponding to ecological environment) will increase the variety of biologic species and improve the status of atmosphere and water resources in the reserve. And deterioration of the atmosphere, water and soil and decrease of biotic life will cause such ecological deterioration problems as desertification of land as well as water loss and soil erosion. The relationship between ecological, biotic and resource environment has decided that the relationship between ecological environmental competitiveness, biotic environmental competitiveness and resource environmental competitiveness are also mutually influential and interactive. Therefore, the relationship between the three should be carefully designed during construction of the indicator system to fully reflect the interactions in between. Of course, the availability of data should also be considered. Take biotic environmental competitiveness for example, there is almost no data and therefore the factors are not included in the indicator system. 3. GEC is not only determined by environmental system, but also influenced by the economic system and social system. GEC itself is an indicator reflecting the status of environmental status and hence it is undoubtedly dependent upon environmental system. But environmental problem is never only a matter of environmental issue; it is at the same time a matter of economic issue and social issue. In the entire environment-economy-society system, environmental system is influenced by economic system and social system, and economic system and social system are likewise influenced by environmental system. To be specific, economic system influences environmental system through production activities and environmental system satisfies the resource demand of economic system; social system influences environmental system through human daily life and environmental system satisfies the ecological demand of social system; economic system satisfies the economic demand of social system and social system satisfies the consumption demand of economic system. The relationship between the three is shown in Fig. 4.1. In this system, of course, everything goes on surrounding humans; it is humans that impose the influences on environment through various economic and social instruments. Therefore, the influence of economic system and social system on environmental system must be adequately considered and reflected in the indicator system. For instance, adding two sub-index, EMC (including two pillars, resource utilization and environmental safety) and ECC (including two pillars, coordination"

Federalism and local autonomy. This variable measures the independence and financial autonomy of the city from national social policies. It also measures the strength of the local welfare state. 11. Co-decision logics of local welfare-state institutions (participation in networks of actors) and co-operation with non-profit organisations in the production of social policies. 12. The dominant welfare mix. This variable measures the degree to which the production of social policies is distinguished by logics oriented towards the state or society (non-profit organisations). In all cities, qualitative and partially quantitative data have been collected, permitting us to describe the different ways in which social policies and social innovations are produced and how they are embedded.8 The data concerning the 12 variables are largely descriptive and were interpreted in various meetings involving the authors of the individual city reports until we arrived at a consensus concerning a general classification of each city through a simple scheme of representations of the values. Following the logic of the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA, see Ragin 1987) we dichotomised all variable values as 1 or 0 (some disputed cases received the value 0.5). The result was a sort of truth table indicating the combination of the presence or absence of specific characteristics from the above-mentioned variables."

Indeed, it has achieved the status of a buzzword in national and European policy circles. US President Obama established no less than two offices for social innovation. The EU has used the term to fund several initiatives, including the research project upon which this book is based. It is then little wonder that the meaning has diluted, sometimes referring to anything that is considered new and that is not technical. Although as an academic concept, it is less wide-ranging, there still remains a broad range of interpretations. Some posit simply that it must constitute a new approach to a particular kind of problem. The Stanford Centre for Social Innovation, for example, describes it as âthe process of inventing, securing support for, and implementing novel solutions to social needs and problemsâ (Phillis et al. 2008, p. 34). This is a conveniently flexible interpretation, yet one could argue that, according to this definition, there is little that does not qualify as a social innovation. Other scholars are more specific in circumscribing the nature of innovation. For example, the SOCIAL POLIS project defined it as âthe satisfaction of alienated human needs through the transformation of social relations: transformations which âimproveâ the governance systems that guide and regulate the allocation of goods and services meant to satisfy those needs, and which establish new governance structures and organizations (discussion forums, political decision-making systems, etc.)â (Moulaert 2010, 2013). This implies not only that an innovation must be radical (transformative), but also that it changes the power structure within the system where it is introduced. The problem with this kind of definition is less with its normative character, but with its essentialist nature. It is true that innovations are about new ideas and purposes deriving from established paths and patterns getting practical; however, it must be likewise considered that they are about processes and ways of development under conditions and in contexts where interaction is not determined and foreseeable ex ante. Innovatory effects of a new product, strategy or service can be path breaking to different degrees. Thinking this way it becomes clear that what is needed is a concept of social innovation as a complex societal process, rather than a mere classificatory definition of an action or product. For the purposes of the WILCO project, we defined social innovation as both products and processes; ideas translated into practical approaches; new in the context where they appear. It was important for us to use such a definition, rather than a more specific one, because one cannot clearly predict what comes out of even a very promising innovation in the course of its development. The problem with defining social innovation resides less in âinnovationâ and much more in the meaning one attributes to âsocialâ. Studying the current literature on conceptualising and defining social innovations, one finds that âsocialâ is mainly equated with âimprovementâ (Phillis 2008), finding better answers to basic needs and more satisfying social relations (Moulaert 2010), and a range of other âgood thingsâ. One way of challenging such an interpretation of âsocialâ has been proposed by Johnson in his essay asking âWhere good ideas come fromâ (2010). He argues that there are four different environments that create new ideas, processes and things:"
271,589,0.224,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"The 12 empirical chapters demonstrate through their extremely varied choice of social domains and communicative figurations how the concept of communicative figurations can be applied as a heuristic framework for producing insights about the ways in which âour social domains are moulded by mediaâ (Hepp and Hasebrink, Chap. 2), or ratherâif we adhere to a strict practice theoretical perspectiveâhow these social domains are moulded by the practices in which social actors are using media to achieve their mundane, professional and political ends: âThe concept of figurations links a micro-analysis of individual practices with a meso-analysis of certain social domains and thus offers us various possibilities to contextualize this with macro questions about societyâ (Hepp and Hasebrink, Chap. 2). The study in Chap. 13 by Andreas Breiter and Arne Hendrik Ruhe is a case in point: Applying the core concepts of figurational theory, their chapter shows how the figurational framework can be used to rigorously map the mediated managerial governance structures of German and English schools. The analysis focuses on the meso (organizational) level, its media ensemble and the role of management information systems, but in order to do so analyzes the media repertoires of individual teachers and administrators,1 and also anchors the communicative practices discovered in the macro national educational governance systems in the two countries: âThe schoolâs media ensemble is a moulding force for changes in communicative practices within the actor constellation of schools, among staff, students and administrators as well as in contact with parentsâ (Breiter and Ruhe, Chap. 13)."
347,280,0.224,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"practices need to adapt to new ways of giving, using and implementing various sorts of advice. This shift towards EAM is furthermore in line with the EUâs general principles of âgood governanceâ (COM 2001: 10) applied in various marine policies such as the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), aiming for a âbroad involvement of stakeholders at all stages of the policy from conception to implementationâ (EC 2002: 6). Our study analyses the problems and challenges faced when a traditional conceptualisation of science-policy interfaces, such as the âideal causal chainâ model, is applied to different cases of environmental governance in the Baltic Sea and suggests ways in which associated problems and challenges might be countered. Applying the EAM concept, with its aspirations to achieve sustainable use of ecosystems in line with place-based requirements and sensitivities of the socioecological system (cf. BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016), opens new opportunities for a more holistic approach to understand and design science-policy interfaces by taking both the natural system (represented via science) and the social system (sociopolitical aspects) into account (cf. Gilek et al. 2015). The widening perspective of EAM could hence contribute to avoiding some of the traditional pitfalls of narrowly assigned science-based management systems. One of these pitfalls is the strongly sector-based marine environmental governance of the Baltic Sea that is studied here. Furthermore, all our case studies present strongly politicised domains of environmental governance (albeit with case-specific differences), where the boundaries between science and policy are continuously blurred and often debated. This implies that political and cultural values heavily influence scientific processes while science on the other hand strongly influences policy developments. This phenomenon is described as the âco-production of science and policyâ (Jasanoff 2004; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998) and highlights key questions about the roles and responsibilities of different actors such as scientists (and the science system) and other relevant stakeholders and policymakers in the interplay between assessment and management. In this âco-producedâ context, new and developed institutional structures and processes of interaction could act as âboundary organisationsâ between science and policy that make environmental problems governable. As Lidskog (2014:3) states: âBy negotiating and renegotiating the boundaries between science and policy, environmental problems and their possible solutions are co-produced. Both science and policy are mobilised in order to solve a specific environmental problemâ."

72,192,0.222,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Introduction Informal settlements, such as favelas (slums), are complex social ecosystems, characterised by their lack of basic services and by their particular social ties. Favelas in Rio de Janeiro are undergoing rapid changes, and new organisations and relationships are beginning to appear. This is largely as a result of the Rio de Janeiro governmentâs policy of âpacificationâ â a strategy to occupy the favelas formerly controlled by drug dealers, aimed at extending citizensâ rights (and duties) in these areas (Fleury, 2012). This chapter discusses these transformations, considering in particular if and how new services are emerging. This discussion is based on one significant case study â Light Recicla. Light Recicla, in Favela Santa Marta, Rio de Janeiro, is a service operated by the cityâs energy company that seeks to reduce the electricity bills of local residents by exchanging recyclable materials for energy credits, helping them to adjust to the new reality brought by pacification. Under the framework of the pacification strategy, commercial companies and favela residents are establishing new relationships. Light Recicla aims to define a new mode of collaboration between the energy company, Light, and its customers that addresses this new set of social relations. Lightâs initiative is considered in this chapter as an example that highlights specific issues related to social innovation, particularly in terms of new social relations. The focus here is on social innovation âas new ideas (products, services and models) that simultaneously meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborationsâ (Murray et al., 2010, p. 3). In the context of the emergence of new market-based relations within the pacification process, the Light"

Such activity typically comes up against strong vested interests and can encounter (sometimes violent) resistance. As a consequence, the politicisation of social innovation research offers an important new lens through which systemic change can be understood: recognising the political dimension of social innovation is not merely a research opportunity, but it also raises significant practical questions and challenges. Political action often prompts a reaction and can lead to institutional confrontation or even danger. Further, when social innovation addresses public welfare issues or aims to drive political change, it typically does so as private action that lacks any formal democratic legitimacy. This is particularly problematic in cases where social innovation acts as a âshadow stateâ substituting for what would otherwise be the welfare responsibilities of the elected state. Such a democratic deficit challenges rights-based models of citizensâ relationship to their government. There is also the more general issue of who is included in, and who is excluded from, social innovation impacts. A second issue concerns the public legitimacy of social innovation. Many social innovations that aim to address institutional voids may initially lack legitimacy to key populations. This is because they often take the form of interventions that combine otherwise distinct institutional logics and models of action in innovative forms and that challenge normative notions of the roles and responsibilities of the discrete sectors. Such hybrid forms of action typically blend the logics and rationales of two or more established sectors to build new organisational structures (i.e., âsocialâ business), processes (i.e., work integration models) or goods and services (i.e., user-led welfare models) that correspond to complex sets of needs and demands in late modern societies better than conventional interventions do. The logics and rationales of action of each conventional sector are quite different and even contradictory at the normative level. As a consequence, the public legitimacy of social innovation (at both normative and cognitive levels: see Suchman, 1995) can often be compromised, with new models variously seen as attempts to privatise the social, dismantle the state or undermine civil society (Nicholls and Cho, 2006). The reaction to the social enterprise/social business hybrid model within social innovation has been particularly hostile since this challenges fundamental principles of the state and civil society as not-for-profit sectors in many countries. Such loss of public legitimacy can have serious consequences in terms of access to resources, market competitiveness, policy support and staff recruitment."
164,601,0.221,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","by Banks in 1972 in reference to Robert Owen. While there is no commonly agreed upon definition of social entrepreneurship, most authors agree that the three defining features of social entrepreneurship are sociality, innovation, and market orientation (Nicholls 2006). The explicit and central social mission of social entrepreneurs is reflected in the special emphasis on projects designed to improve the quality of life of humans: health, nutrition, education, training, and the creation of stable and productive jobs (Bornstein 2007). Opinions differ, however, as to what extent social entrepreneurs are necessarily engaged in business activities. For instance Ashoka founder Bill Drayton contends that social entrepreneurs are âchange makers,â but not necessarily business people. According to Drayton people like Florence Nightingale, who revolutionized health care, are good historical examples of social entrepreneurs. They were committed to creating change in their societies and employed entrepreneurial principles, but they did not see themselves as business operators (Lamb 2011). Observers also disagree over whether social entrepreneurship refers only to nonprofit or also to profit-seeking enterprises. While some authors require the primacy of social targets over all other objectives, many so-called hybrid organizations also exist that operate with a double or triple bottom line (i.e., aiming at social, financial, and environmental returns on investment) (Dees 1998; Guclu et al. 2002; Mair and MartÃ­ 2006; Nicholls 2006; Bornstein 2007; Seelos and Mair 2007; Certo and Miller 2008). The idea of a triple bottom line was introduced by Spreckley (1981), who proposed to add criteria other than financial performance to measure the success of enterprises. The term was then promoted by John Elkington (1997) in his book Cannibals with Forks. In the absence of a common definition, an exact number of existing social enterprises is difficult to find. A recent report counted 55,000 social enterprises in the UK alone in 2006 (Brown and Campanale 2006). Ashoka, one of the pioneers in supporting social entrepreneurs, has 2,500 âfellowsâ worldwide.3 The organization, which was set up in 1980 by Bill Drayton, brings communities of social entrepreneurs together to help leverage their impacts, to broaden the scale of their ideas, and to capture and disseminate examples of best practices. To this end Ashoka selects social entrepreneurs as âAshoka Fellowsâ and provides them with living stipends for an average of three years, professional support, and access to a global network of peers in 70 countries. The organization started with an annual budget of US$50,000 and grew to nearly US$35 million by 2008, and is now active in 60 countries. Several organizations have followed the approach pioneered by Ashoka. Two well-known examples are the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship and the Skoll Foundation. Launched in 1998 by Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, and his wife Hilde, the Schwab Foundation promotes âentrepreneurial solutions and social commitment with a clear impact at the grassroots level.â4 The foundationâs activities focus on supporting social entrepreneurs strategically by"

In other words, the prevalent development model promotes the integration of remote communities into the market economy through industrial development approaches based on the use of fossil fuels, either directly (through the industrialisation of agricultural production) or indirectly (through specialised machinery). This appears to be the only means of escaping poverty.2 The ecological crisis of our current times cannot be understated. The crisis is global: 60 % of our ecosystems have been degraded (MEA 2005; Steffen et al. 2004), and in many respects, we have exceeded the safe operating space of the planet. The distortion of the nitrogen cycle is primarily attributed to industrial agriculture and the use of fertilisers (RockstrÃ¶m et al. 2009). As we head towards the erosion of our own natural resource base on a global level, these current development trends run counter to the increasingly accepted notion of sustainable development. A more sustainable global future therefore requires a broader search for pathways where short- and long-term benefits for people come at the lowest possible environmental cost and the lowest possible burden and stress on individuals in terms of working time (Haberl et al. 2004, 2011). Guided by this focus on sustainable development, our primary aim is to gain a better understanding of these transition processes âat the peripheryâ along with the transformative potential and impacts that are generated at the society-nature interface thereof. The conceptual framework of sociometabolic transitions (Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl 2007) is an attempt in this direction. In this context, local rural subsistence communities have been empirically investigated to understand the systemic interrelations between food production systems and the resulting environmental pressures. Comparing and contrasting these cases in terms of their demographic, sociometabolic, and agro-ecological profiles has aided the modelling of development trajectories for larger regions. A variable that is often left out from such analysis is âtime useâ and its link to sociometabolic transitions. While we have previously illustrated our findings on the environmental pressures triggered by the specific material, energy and land use activities in the different communities (see Fischer-Kowalski et al. 2011), the focus of this chapter is the social pressure on individuals in terms of working time and how the burden of labour changes with agricultural development. To this end, we revisit Boserupâs (1965, 1981) theory of agricultural change in subsistence systems and, in particular, her hypothesis on increasing area productivity at the expense of labour productivity as a consequence of technological intensification in traditional farming systems. Boserupâs theory provides a framework for comparing the burden of labour among four contemporary subsistence communities in the global south that are in different stages of agricultural development. We will first provide a brief overview of Boserupâs hypothesis, followed by our sociometabolic concept of human time as a (limited) biophysical resource. What follows is a brief description of the four case studies and methods used for data collection. We then present the main findings and conclude with a brief reassessment of our hypothesis."

376,453,0.22,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The richly interconnected view of resource systems in an SES stands in opposition to strategies that attempt to reduce system complexity by focusing on only a small number of target resources, species, or indicators as is typical of maximum sustained yield and steady-state natural resource management (Holling and Meffe 1996). History has shown that these types of management strategies are often ecologically unsustainable because of unrecognized slow system change, sudden unpredicted disturbance, and/or unknown interconnections. On the social dimension, these approaches often fail as a result of an inability to understand what people want from natural resources, a lack of capacity to govern human resource use, and the broad perception of an accompanying policy or distribution of benefits as unjust. Given the evolving nature of complex adaptive systems and their lack of predictability, much of the work on SESs in rangelands and elsewhere focuses on developing responsive policy and governance that supports system resilience (e.g., Walker et al. 2004; Armitage et al. 2009) rather than attempting to provide specific and relatively inflexible resource management prescriptions. Social groups do not maintain consistent or uniform relationships with their surrounding environment, but change in either social or ecological patterns cannot necessarily be attributed to a corresponding driver in the other system (Vayda and McCay 1975). Resource management and governance policies must therefore monitor and be responsive to ecological and social processes that may or may not create new drivers of change within the SES. It is the inclusion of both ecological and social variables within the frame of analysis that makes the SES framework useful for management. Changes in the price of beef or altered land tenure policies, for example, have to be considered alongside fluctuations in climate and vegetation composition when planning management actions or policies for a rangeland SES. Problems that cross scales or levels within SESs can prove challenging for two reasons: perception and communication. First, the occurrence of a phenomenon at one level must be perceived as having been caused by a driver at another level. Second, that observation has to be communicatedâpersuasivelyâto the person or organization capable of solving the problem, and that person or entity has to decide to address the problem. Solutions involving changes in policy need to be effectively communicated to the affected population, ideally with buy-in from the affected populations. The perception problem can be met with a combination of thorough cross-scale monitoring and diverse information networks. Communication problems require adaptations to governance structures and strategies that facilitate information sharing and learning across sectors and hierarchical levels. An increasing number of groups, such as the Sustainable Rangelands Roundtable (http://www. sustainablerangelands.org/) and the California Rangeland Conservation Coalition (http://carangeland.org/) in the USA, are devoted to encouraging this type of communication about rangelands and range management. Inclusion of various stakeholders in goal-setting, planning, monitoring, research, data interpretation, and decision making is one way that managers can create"
376,347,0.219,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","State-and-transition models were introduced as a âmanagement language,â rather than an ecological theory, to organize and interpret rangeland vegetation dynamics (Westoby et al. 1989). They provided an alternative to the range model that had been severely criticized in the 1970s and 1980s for being overly reliant on linear, directional vegetation dynamics that were unable to account for nonreversible vegetation change, especially woody plant encroachment and invasion by exotic invasive species (Briske et al. 2005). An influential report by the US National Research Council (NRC 1994) endorsed development and adoption of an alternative management model based on the STM framework and the Society for Range Management quickly supported this endorsement (SRM Task Group 1995). The US Department of AgricultureâNatural Resource Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) formally adopted STMs for rangeland assessment in the late 1990s and established programs to develop and organize these models for all 50 states in the USA. A National Ecological Site Manual was developed and adopted in 2010 to standardize the use of ecological site descriptions and STMs among the NRCS, Bureau of Land Management, and US Forest Service (BLM 2010). State-and-transition models are organized as a collection of all recognized or anticipated stable states that individual ecological sites may support (Bestelmeyer et al. 2003; Stringham et al. 2003). Individual stable states (e.g., grassland or shrubland) include transient and reversible shifts in species composition that occur in response to disturbances or self-regulating processes. These internal state dynamics are referred to as community phases and represent variation in species composition associated with wet and dry years, periodic intensive grazing, and fire frequency. In contrast, individual states are assumed to be separated by thresholds that are considered to be irreversible without management intervention. Ecological indicators of state variables, controlling variables, and to lesser extent feedback mechanisms that underpin state resilience are used to determine if a state is trending toward or away from pending thresholds (Briske et al. 2008). This information can inform managers of the need to implement actions to modify state resilience to achieve desired outcomes (Watson et al. 1996; Bagchi et al. 2013) (Fig. 6.5). State-and-transition models have subsequently been organized around ecological resilience to link them to an accepted ecological theory and to accommodate scientific, in addition to management knowledge (Briske et al. 2008). In relation to resilience, individual states exist within a single basin of attraction that is consistent with engineering resilience and thresholds represent boundaries between multiple"

Second, scholars have tended to privilege the charitable dimension of solidarity by focusing on the (financial) help to the needy. While this aspect is significant, it does not consider the political dimension of solidarity. In fact, people reveal solidarity with other needy persons when participating in collective actions (e.g. political protests, public claims making, lobbying, communication campaigns) that aims to improve the situation of these groups by mobilising public support, lobbying stakeholders, and/or changing public policies on their behalf (Giugni and Passy 2001). Finally, previous studies are an important source of inspiration in order to identify factors that can influence solidarity practices. First, scholars have highlighted the importance of socio-demographic factors and social traits (e.g. age, gender, education, social class) for grasping the conditions, structures, and dynamics of solidarity (Hechter 1988). Some studies (Neill and Gidengil 2006; Valentova 2016) have shown that voluntary engagement tends to replicate the public/private divide by focusing especially on male-dominated and âpublicâ activities. It has been revealed that younger and older citizens are more active in social movements, because of different levels of âbiographical availabilityâ in the life course (Beyerlein and Bergstrand 2013). Furthermore, different levels of commitment in solidarity actions can be patterned by citizensâ differentiation in terms of personal resources and skills, such as income and education, by the respondentsâ social status and affiliation to social class (Verba et al. 1978; Cainzos and Voces 2010). Second, education and subjective class position are also a measure of social centrality, usually linked to social capital, and previous research has shown that social capital measures are particularly important for our topic (Putnam et al. 2003; Jenkins 1983; Bourdieu 1986). In particular, we wish to highlight the role of interpersonal trust, informal networks, and social relations. The assumption is that social capital is the necessary âglueâ of social cohesion (Chan et al. 2006; Jeannotte 2000; Delhey 2007), and it is tightly associated with values such as trust in others and with frequency of social connections. Several studies have shown that trust in others is associated with a wide range of positive outcomes in areas such as personal wellbeing (Helliwell and Wang 2010), crime rates, and even mortality rates (Lochner et al. 2003). Also, social trust can determine how much people in a society are willing to cooperate with one another, thus fostering solidarity actions. Similarly, having a good frequency of social"

To network theories means to build relations among theories. This approach is not a new idea. There are forerunners: for example, in 1992, Bauersfeld presented an integrated analysis of a teaching and learning situation using various theoretical approaches (1992b). He has also used strategies to compare and contrast radical constructivism and activity theory in order to clarify their (in-) compatibility (1992a). In 1998, Maier and Steinbring published a comparison of two theoretical approaches on processes of understanding based on the same empirical episode. These examples show that German researchers used the strategies of comparing theoretical approaches and integrating theoretical aspects to comprehend practice. Such strategies, called networking strategies, have been systematized, resulting in a landscape of four pairs of complementary strategies (Fig. 5.1). This landscape orders these strategies according to their potential for integration between two poles, non-relation of ignoring other theories, and uniï¬cation of theories globally. The ï¬rst two pairs (understanding and making understandable, comparing and contrasting), acknowledge the theoriesâ identities and the diversity of the theories as a resource in the ï¬eld. They point to the basic necessity of understanding theories. This ï¬rst pair may take place in a deepened way while comparing and contrasting theories. The second pair, comparing and contrasting, leads to awareness of differences and commonalities, thus learning from other perspectives. The third pair, combining and coordinating, is a step towards bridging theories. Its strategies allow working with different theories to build a conceptual framework or include complementary views into researching a problem. The fourth pair, locally integrating and synthesizing, leads to more comprehensive theoretical frameworks. Local integration may occur when a concept can be interpreted from different theoretical views, thus integrating the concept into other theories. Synthesizing is meant when two or more theories can be imbedded into a more holistic theoretical framework. While there are some cases of local integration, a case of synthesizing has not yet been achieved (see Bikner-Ahsbahs and Prediger 2010). During the last decade, research methods using networking of theories have been developed in a number of projects. These methods encompass repeated exchanges"

247,44,0.217,Humanities World Report 2015,"Archaeology, more than any other humanities discipline, benefits from the natural sciences (and their associated technology). But, increasingly in the field of environmental and climate science, the influence may be working the other way around. Archaeological research is becoming a more important source of evidence in these fields.20 History is closely intertwined with the social sciences, all of which include a historical dimension or subdivision, whether political, legal, social or economic. Indeed, the fact that history so obviously contributes to the social sciences says something about the arbitrariness of the distinction between humanities and social sciences. Also, history is becoming increasingly important in the understanding of environmental change. This is part of a wider trend, the âhistorical turnâ, where more and more academic disciplines are embracing an interest in historical perspectives. Historical research over long time-periods can bring a new perspective to the social sciences. For example, it has been shown that over time the world has witnessed a substantial decline in violent interpersonal conflicts. For instance, in Europe over the last three or four centuries there has been a substantial drop in homicide rates.21 Furthermore, it seems clear that there is a close and sustained correlation between manslaughter and alcohol consumption. Linguistics clearly influences the fields of psychology and sociology through social linguistics and psycholinguistics. It is also relevant to computer science."
347,279,0.216,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Science-based advice is universally regarded and used as a primary trustworthy basis for environmental management and decision-making. However, at the same time, in many areas, there is an ambiguity and increasing concern about the sole dependence on expertise from the (natural) sciences, which often acts to the detriment of sufficient consideration of other knowledge claims, stakeholder perspectives and values held by actors such as NGOs, citizens or business people. Bijker et al. (2009: 1) have called this phenomenon the paradox of scientific authority and asked the question of âhow can scientific advice be effective and influential in an age in which the status of science and/or scientists seems to be as low as it has ever been?â One reason for this paradox lies in the fact that science becomes politicised whenever it is called into a political context (Weingart 1999) and is hence subject to constraints, i.e. rules, norms and evaluation criteria, other than those set by the scientific community. A basic challenge is that the demarcation that exists between the spheres of science and politics falls apart in such contexts, which consequently leads to concerns and potential conflicts about the legitimate role of science and its relation to policy. Both the role of science-based advice and the political decisions based on it may therefore become contested with respect to credibility, legitimacy and accountability (cf. Cash et al. 2003). In management practice, a distinction is often made between a science system (representing factual knowledge claims) and a social system (representing political, business and other concerns of public life) â a division that is inscribed in the institutional design of most policy systems in modern societies. Science is responsible for providing the best available knowledge in terms of a presumed value-free and objective input to political decision-making, which is accordingly seen as most rational and democratically legitimated (Funtowicz and Strand 2007; Wilson 2009). This idealised model of interaction between science and policy relies on what has been called the âideal causal chainâ of implementing scientific knowledge in policy processes (Fig. 8.1; Gezelius 2008). The ecosystem approach to management (EAM) is seen as a necessary and idealistic approach for managing marine resources and other environmental issues with regard to all five areas of environment and risks analysed here (Backer et al. 2010; Garcia et al. 2003; Hammer 2015).

223,51,0.216,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"The Relevance of the Spatial Dimension and the Spatial Turn From the perspective of geography-making, which begins with the premises that all socially and culturally relevant geographies are constructed realities, the spatial conditions and spatial relations of individual actions are fundamental to the formation and structuration of social realities. A prime example is the current globalization affecting various aspects of everyday life. Systematic social theories have largely ignored the spatial dimension of social life. The reasons for this omission are profound and require thorough reconstruction of the underlying modes of thought. Without such analysis, one runs the risk of importing the traditional spatial perspective into the social sciences and cultural studies. The fact that such uncritical adoption of the conventional spatial perspective is neither productive nor insightful is exemplified by the âspatial,â or âgeographical,â turn in the social sciences, cultural studies, and the humanities (see DÃ¶ring & Thielmann, 2008; Foucault, 1999; Levy, 1999; GÃ¼nzel, 2009; SchlÃ¶gel, 2002; Soja, 1989; Warf & Arias, 2008). The absence of the spatial dimension in social and cultural theorizing contrasts with the spatial obsession characteristic of early studies in human geography, a field that emerged in the late nineteenth century as a space-centered science applying to the study of human individuals and societies. This orientation and the way of thinking underlying it have significant ramifications for geography as an academic discipline and entail problematic political implications. Traditional human geographyâs rather simplistic focus on space and distance as determining dimensions of behavior results in an emphasis on the individual as part of the human species and neglects his or her capacity to perform social actions, which is fundamental for the meaningful construction of social and cultural realities. Arrival at this perspective needed a theoretical and not always successful debate lasting more than a century. The insights it has contributed greatly help the current debate about the spatial turn in the social and cultural sciences, identify its implications (some of which are problematic), and detect its shortcomings on the background of the history of geographical research. Observed from the current theoretical debates, the first turn from human geography to social geography as of the early twentieth century was theoretically uninformed about social science and showed that merely integrating the social dimension"

It establishes both a new form of participation and policy-making. The CA is not only based on new practices but also introduces changes in social responsibilities (public and private) in the local welfare system. By bringing about a new culture in the management of the welfare system, it also affects attitudes and values within local government. It is an example of social innovation resulting from a two-way process: (1) A top-down process, in the sense that it was proposed by the municipal government, which (2) intersects with a bottom-up process based on the effort and interests of different organisations and social networks that work within the cityâs social welfare system. We consider that this is a programme with great potential, and it could be implemented in other cities with similar conditions. The programme was established in April 2005. The ultimate goal of the programme is to redistribute responsibilities in the social welfare sector in Barcelona through a broad agreement among representatives of the main social agents in the sector. The intention is to create a strategic framework shared by all participating entities. This is a new philosophy, which integrates the diversity of activities that are carried out in the local social welfare system into a single framework or joint strategy. It is based on a policy decision to coordinate the diverse activities of different social actors. No one loses their space for action; rather, it is possible to improve results by combining efforts."
167,488,0.216,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"Understanding the ways in which Arctic science has been conducted is crucial to understanding how and to what degree intersectional analyses have been integrated into this body of scholarship. Intersectional research is generally part of the broader domain of social sciences, which itself has experienced âscience warsâ, a contestation of methodologies, methods, and approaches (Keating and Della Porta 2010). Social sciences operate at high levels of abstraction, where social inquiry includes exploring ontologies, epistemologies, approaches, methodologies, and methods without predetermining the process of inquiry (ibid). As such, different processes of inquiry result in different constructions and productions of knowledge. Feminists have long demonstrated a gendered and masculinist bias within concepts and approaches to scholarship, not least exemplified by the emphasis on rationality, objectivity, and public domains, often embodied by research in the natural sciences and visibly expressed in un-reflexive, silent authorship reinforcing âan unreflective orientation toward objectivist traditions and normsâ (Gray 2017: 180). A core feature of feminist and intersectional methodological approaches therefore includes the practice of âreflexivityâ whereby the researcher is ââresponsibleâ and âresponsiveâ to her work and her âsubjectsâ of study because it makes explicit the deliberative movement of her scholarshipâ (Ackerly et al. 2006: 258, cited in Agathangelou and Turcotte 2008). Reflexivity allows for insight into phenomena while also illuminating how such insights were derived: âthe closer an academic discipline is aligned with the natural science model the greater the pressure can be to engage in un-reflexive silent authorshipâ (Gray: 182). Thus, the dominance of a natural science heavy Arctic scholarship informed by objectivist methods plays a significant role in the acceptance and comprehension of what intersectional analy-"

347,33,0.216,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The interactions between the primarily science-based assessment sphere (i.e. generation of knowledge on environmental status, pressures, risks and problems) and the management sphere (i.e. decisions on and implementation of actions) have been described as key processes in environmental governance (Renn et al. 2011; Rice 2005). Science has since long been seen as the primary provider of knowledge and advice to guide environmental policy-making, especially in the case of managing environmental risks stemming from industrial technologies and pollutants (Karlsson et al. 2011). This has also been the case in the Baltic Sea region, both nationally and in relation to the activities of international organisations such as HELCOM and ICES (Udovyk and Gilek 2013). However, interactions over science-policy interfaces (e.g. connected with the evaluation of what constitutes good environmental status and unacceptable levels of risk) are usually complicated by severe challenges connected with complexity, ignorance, uncertainty and ambiguity (Renn 2008; Stirling 2007), which frequently result in controversy in both society and science on appropriate risk assessment and management. It has been argued that scientific uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements and conflicts are particularly problematic for marine environmental governance when implementing holistic management approaches such as EAM and MSP (Linke et al. 2014; Rice 2005; Wilson 2009). Observations of impaired public trust in science and recognition of other legitimate knowledge providers, such as practitioners, stakeholders and experts based elsewhere than in traditional research organisations, have also been linked to cases of severe scientific uncertainty (Irwin and Michael 2003), in combination with a common politicisation of science (e.g. Eriksson et al. 2010; Weingart 1999). In response, Stirling (2007)2 has argued that different types of environmental issues characterised by uncertainty and ambiguity require an expansion of traditional strategies in science and policy, to include precautionary and participative approaches. As a consequence, the relationship between science and policy is changing on both a theoretical and practical level, particularly with regard to complex environmental issues such as marine governance. It is, however, despite a long and Stirling (2007) differentiates between four types of scientific incertitude: risk (quantitative data and knowledge exist), uncertainty (qualitative understanding of outcome, but not probabilities), ambiguity (poor knowledge about potential outcome) and ignorance; see Linke et al.

99,323,0.214,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In transitional countries, civil society is a space for the self-organisation and mobilisation of citizens to protect and to promote their interests. Civic norms, values and networks produce a necessary level of social capital to build trust among local stakeholders and to strengthen social cohesion. In this case, there existed a fertile soil for social innovations and, after a certain period of time, social entrepreneurship. RODA was established as a successful social innovation because it was in possession of certain social capital mostly from middle class citizens that were its key actors. Also, they were among the first organisations that actively worked in family policy area counting on engagement of families. They became recognised and branded themselves so they are now the organisation that almost every mother has heard about, which contributes to their success as social innovation. It is obvious that developmental capacity of this innovation, being owned by a civic organisation, increases on a steady basis. Empirical evidence says that civil society is a space for self-organisation and selfpromotion of the middle class, which is the core of âurban citizenshipâ. It brings the issue of fragmentation of the space of civil society as a relevant topic for further research. Important question is the one of capacities and inequalities. What are the differences in possibilities of organisations with developed social connections and social capital derived from their middle class status as opposed to the organisations founded by lower class citizens? Also, what are the differences between urban and rural based organisation? The case made impact on the local and national welfare systems in terms of policy making process and governance producing new welfare culture in this field. Besides such promising development of the analysed social innovation in the space of civil society, the social welfare system, which is in the hands of government and the city, has still not become the space of viable social innovations. Overregulation and paternalistic style of government, where the authorities own public policy, remains the major obstacle for developing social innovations (BeÅ¾ovan et al. 2013). Some earlier research (BeÅ¾ovan 2010) identifies the problems of a lack of coordination and poor cooperation between different local stakeholders.

In the next chapter, Chap. 8, Thomas Wiedmann considers the environmental and social impacts of the increase in global trade experienced during recent decades. He discusses how, for example, todayâs longer and increasingly complex global supply chains make it more difficult to connect the environmental impacts of production to the final consumer of the goods and services. In addition to discussing developments in analytical tools and data requirements, Wiedmann also discusses the broadening of indicators. He reviews how studies now extend beyond the traditional analysis of carbon emissions, to include other environmental indicators such as land and water use and, importantly, social indicators such as child labour, which extend the analysis into the âSocial equityâ lobe of Fig. 1. The chapter by Angela Druckman and Tim Jackson (9) follows neatly from Thomas Wiedmannâs Chap. (8), as it takes the concept of âfootprintingâ, which Wiedmann applies to trade, and applies it to household consumption. Both approaches are based on consumption perspective accounting, which uses whole systems, life cycle thinking to attribute all impacts along supply chains to final consumers. Druckman and Jackson review the determinants of the carbon footprints of Western households, the composition of average household footprints, and also discuss the rebound effect. They conclude that while it is vital to address the systems of provision of food, energy, housing and transportation, structural income growth presents a key challenge and that we should seek solutions that provide low carbon lifestyles with high levels of well-being. Once again, âdevelopmentâ must not to be equated with economic growth. In Chap. 10 Marlyne Sahakian picks up on the importance of the structure of the economy and the well-being it provides by introducing the concept of the social and solidarity economy, fully embracing the âSocial equityâ lobe in Fig. 1. As noted above, a high quality of life is the objective, not just economic activity as measured by GDP. The concept is people centric: it aims to place service to communities ahead of profit and embraces the notion of reciprocity. Examples of activities of the social and solidarity economy include social entrepreneurship, crowd funding, fair trade, community currencies and some forms of peer-to-peer sharing. Many of these activities are niche: they are often at the grassroots level operating at the margins of the dominant capitalist economy. Hence, to make progress, the issue of scale is, she says, the greatest challenge. Importantly for this book, Sahakian analyses the linkages between the social and solidarity economy and industrial ecology and finds many synergies. She also, however, notes a tension that is a challenge for the future, whereby industrial ecology generally prioritises the environment, whereas the social and solidarity economy prioritises people. In the terms of Fig. 1, a genuine balance must be found between the âEnvironmental compatibilityâ and âSocial equityâ lobes. In Chap. 11, Megha Shenoy focuses attention on developing countries â the âglobal Southâ â and so returns to the original focus of sustainable development. The holistic approach of industrial ecology can provide a valuable platform on which to develop strategies and policies for sustainable development. In turn, the development of industrial ecology thinking should be informed by experience in the"

We label the first one as a thesis about the consequences of the level of social capital. According to this argument, the more dense and diverse the social networks of an individual are, as well as the more trusting a person is, the more prone he or she is to get involved in cooperative behavior (Coleman 1988) andâconsequentlyâin solidarity action. The second stance may be labeled as a thesis on the consequences of the type of social capital. It assumes that the type of structural and normative elements of social capital affects individualâs propensity to engage in solidarity action. Two types of social capital are differentiated in this context. The so-called bonding or thick social capital is based on relatively homogenous relations with family and friends. It entails strong norms of mutual support and thus might be exclusive. It is claimed that, for example, closed self-help groups may be based on this type of social capital and due to the effects of this form of social capital is named by some authors an âinwardlookingâ social capital. Extreme form of this asset is close to traditional familialism (Banfield 1967; Portes 1998). On the other hand, the so-called bridging social capital, based on horizontal, crosscutting social networks and values of openness and generalized trust, positively contributes to social cooperation and public good at a systemic level (Putnam et al. 1994; Granovetter 1973). When explaining causal mechanism which constitutes relation between social capital and solidarity action, a more general framework of its role in shaping political participation may be referred to. Following van Stekelenburg and Klandermans (2013), three mechanisms arising from diverse components of social capital may be pointed to in this regard. Firstly, the structural element of social capital refers to whom people can reach in actions of political participation. For example, engaging time to support the rights of refugees living in the camp in oneâs country may result from personal networks to volunteers already engaged in helping this group. Secondly, the relational component of social capital refers to informational, physical and emotional incentives toward solidarity action. Thus, the bigger and more diverse oneâs personal network is, the more information one has about, for example, significant adversity that other people are experiencing, methods of action to engage in help, possibilities to pool resources for action. Finally, the cognitive element encompasses shared representations, interpretations, systems of meaningâit may lead to consciousness raising or shaping oneâs political beliefs. This aspect of social embeddedness contributes to individualsâ beliefs about whose and which"

164,53,0.213,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","factors underlying poverty (Meinzen-Dick et al. 2004; von Braun et al. 2009, 44). These shortcomings led us to the development of a more inclusive and interdisciplinary research framework, that of marginality. Kant (1819) noted that a concept is a general representation that is common to several specific objects. Accordingly, the concept of marginality is an abstraction of the idea that the causal complexities underlying peopleâs living conditions interact in ways that are at systemic margins. These conditions are far from what would be considered optimal, in balance, just, equal, sufficient, good, or fairâattributes that describe conditions and positions in human life that are enabling and supportive, and that are used to define poverty. Despite the critiques of marginality in social science (Cullen and Pretes 2000; Del Pilar and Udasco 2004), the persistence of marginality as a concept (Dickie-Clark 1966) should be regarded as an indication of the demand to express observations of a similar kind across different epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina 1999), and to find solutions, here, to the phenomena of poverty. The problem of measuring the degree of marginalization is that the reference is not fixed or unknown, and therefore when used as a theory marginality has been criticized for the lack of construct validity (Del Pilar and Udasco 2004, 11). In their critique, however, those authors reviewed the use of marginality as a theory and came to the conclusion that âmarginality cannot work [as a theory] if it has multiple levels of meaning.â This critique of the marginality concept as a theory also rests on the belief that a concept must be a âuniform kind of mental representationâ (Weiskopf 2009, 145). Weiskopf rejects this assumption in psychology and outlines a pluralist theory of concepts in which they are constituted by multiple representational kinds. In the following we present a framework for the investigation of marginalityânot a theory of marginality. Although poverty can be observed in many different forms and is caused by many different factors, all forms of poverty can be described through the concept of marginality. Someone who is poor will always be marginalized in one or more dimensions, whereas the socio-cultural context and individual perception will define in which and in how many dimensions someone needs to be marginalized in order to be considered poor. The aim of establishing a concept of marginality is therefore to better understand the various causal complexities of poverty by deepening and broadening the scope of scientific investigation through: 1. identifying common causalities of poverty across scientific disciplines, and 2. including phenomena that are not typically considered as poverty or contributing to poverty alone (e.g., living in harsh or resource scarce environments). Deepening and broadening the scope of investigation thereby also includes incorporating theories and models from other (non-social science) epistemic cultures and scientific disciplines. In that sense marginality is not only a concept, but also a conceptual framework. It is a framework for different theories of poverty within which various models can be tested. Frameworks. Theories and models are understood as ânested set[s] of theoretical concepts, which range from the most general to the most detailed types of"

Meanwhile, we retain an inexhaustible reservoir of vision and of contrariness. Once this power of resistance enlists practical ingenuity and living social forces in its service, it can do more than may seem feasible. The fact about us is that we are the beings who never entirely fit into the social and conceptual worlds that we build and inhabit. There is always more in us than in them. Although we can improve them, we can never improve them enough to lose reasons to resist them. We can â indeed we must â deny them the last word, and keep it for ourselves. We can â indeed we should â see, do and create more than they countenance. Social innovation is the creation of a new way of acting and cooperating in some part of society. As society is divided into distinct domains that are arranged according to different rules and conceptions â the worlds of business, of politics, of social services, of the âthird sectorâ, of the academy or of the media â the practice of social innovation must always begin in one of these areas. It must identify a problem that has not been solved in that corner of society and that cannot be solved by its conventional practices and established institutions. It must exemplify, through a practical initiative, a way of understanding the problem and of dealing with it. It must do its work in such a way that the initiative does more than address the immediate problem. It must also suggest a path for the reform of the part of social life in which it began, with implications for the larger society. For example, if it begins as business it must be successful as business and yet effective as well in the advancement of a concern that business, as now organised, commonly fails to share. Its innovations must point beyond themselves. Today the opportunity for such a practice is likely to be greatest in departments of social life that are orphaned by both the state and the market, or that lie in a netherworld between economic and political action, or that require initiatives that neither business firms nor political parties seem capable of conceiving and promoting. Such an activity cannot take place unless it has an agent. Social regimes are organised to reproduce themselves. If they allowed no room for their own reshaping, social innovation would be impossible â except through individual and collective rebellion, in the favouring circumstance of crisis. If they had done much more to open themselves to challenge and change than they have, social innovation might be unnecessary. It is in the real, intermediate situation that social innovation becomes both needed and possible as a practice bidding to become a movement. It takes its cue from the failure of political parties and of business firms, and more generally of all established organisations in society, to do what needs to be done to address the unresolved problems of society."

According to Tardif (2005, p. 25), the approach is based on the notion of the emergence of social innovation: As a localized process initiated by different actors who seek to change the interactions taking place between themselves as well as with their organizational and institutional environment â the whole with the aim to counteract the impact of crises while attempting to reconcile the different levels of individual interest, public interest and common good. The statistical analysis of data will make it possible to move from a micro to a meso and macro approach to studying social innovation. The assumption is that there are objects of study of relevance for social innovation that are not observable at the micro scale. At the meso level of analysis, such a database will allow for a new reading of social innovations in terms of the mechanisms, configurations, evolution and modes of dissemination in time and across locations and sectors of activity. The approach will, moreover, make it possible to focus on phenomena hitherto little studied in the QuÃ©bec context, such as the emergence and dissemination of innovation clusters, including their patterns and paths of institutionalisation or even their configuration into an innovation system, and to examine their impacts on social transformation, in particular with regard to the QuÃ©bec development model. This framework, once applied to QuÃ©bec, may be extended to other areas in order to conduct international comparisons. There are, indeed, times and territories where social innovations tend to multiply, taking the form of innovation clusters, especially at the onset of crises or in economies with plural tendencies (Klein et al., 2013). Innovations are, then, oriented along emerging socio-technical paradigms, such as new representations of problems and possible solutions or experiments that were successfully carried out in organisations and local communities. For example, during the 1980s and 1990s in QuÃ©bec, when the crisis of Fordism and the welfare state became apparent, social innovations arose in the areas of labour, people services, collective enterprises, public policies and local development (the areas that CRISES focuses on). Using the CRISES Database on Social Innovations, it will be possible to trace the dynamics of the emergence of these innovations as well as their spread into clusters and their wider impacts on society. For example, a researcher might study the proximity effect, which is a phenomenon that promotes collective dynamics with the potential to modulate or reject the dominant forms of social control or"

170,87,0.209,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,1.3 Purpose The purpose of this chapter is to take The Hague discussion a step further by constructing theories of change based on the framework developed. The practical implication of building these so-called theories of change will be the availability of alternative results chain models for the conduct of information society impact research relative to the Millennium Development Goals. The chapter has three major sections. The first one discusses the framework which resulted from The Hague ICT4D meeting in 2010. The second elaborates on the theories of change. The third presents an essay on evaluating impact and unintended outcomes.

Nature-based solutions as social-spatial interventions have a transformative impact in the relations between people and nature. First, nature-based solutions contribute in the mental and physical health and wellbeing of people in cities (Andersson et al. 2015; Ambrey and Fleming 2014, p. 1298; Bratman et al. 2015; Buchel and Frantzeskaki 2015; Carrus et al. 2015). Reconnecting with nature in cities can contribute to social ties, establishment of sense of community and social cohesion (Kazmierczak 2013). Second, nature-based solutions are systemic ways on locally responding to climate change pressures. So far research has focused on the (potential) insurance value of naturebased solutions that revolves around the restorative capacity of these solutions deeming them effective for climate change adaptation and mitigation (Green et al. 2016; Haase et al. 2012; Kabisch et al. 2016; Mullaney et al. 2015; Andersson et al. Chap. 4 this volume). We add to this understanding is that nature-based solutions can have regenerative impact (Carrus et al. 2015, p. 226). We argue that for understanding the impact of nature-based solutions in cities, we need to attend to their social production (Ernston 2013). In this way, we will understand how nature-based solutions as social-spatial settings, they mediate the need and ability of actors and communities to establish a positive dependence of place motivating them to restore it (Tidball and Stedman 2012, p. 297). Third, transition initiatives are instrumental in creating and localizing nature-based solutions, moving from a passive experience âof natureâ to an active experience âwith (making) natureâ. In this way, transition initiatives experiment with nature-based solutions, learn-by-doing on how to adapt them to city-specific and place-specific situations and geophysical characteristics and create new narratives and understandings of their benefits. As thus, nature-based solutions are seeds of transformation of local practice and local space towards more sustainable ones. In line with the above, nature-based solutions as social-ecological settings require social actors and social processes to be implemented in cities. In this chapter we examine the way nature-based solutions scale as a social process that includes transition initiatives driving their social production. Specifically, we examine, how transition initiatives as actor configurations that establish, experiment and localise nature-based solutions shift them from âsolutionsâ to social configurations, making nature-based solutions the new âurban commons of sustainabilityâ and in this way contributing to accelerating sustainability transitions in cities."
72,186,0.209,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"bridging the gap between welfare politics and social innovation, four points are of particular importance. First of all, it should be taken into account that many social policy textbooks have a narrow focus on just state policies, debates and decisions on reforms within state institutions, whereby societal actors are brought in through their role within social movements and pressure groups that try to influence the nature of state decisions on welfare â in other words by protest, negotiation and deliberation. However, when it comes to welfare provision (i.e., socio-economic contributions), organised societal actors often get little attention in mainstream textbooks. It is usual to find the state, the market and the family cited as the three pillars of welfare provision (e.g., Esping-Andersen, 2002). Civil society and the third sector, which contribute to new and innovative welfare arrangements not only through participation in the decision-making process but also by creating and preserving all kind of social services, are typically not mentioned. There is, therefore, a need to learn more about the history of welfare as a history of social innovations â a feature of a civil society. There has always been an important role for many social movements and organisations in inventing and creating welfare arrangements of their own â mutual organisations in the field of social security, co-operatives as early social enterprises and voluntary associations that have run all kind of services. This rich history of a social economy of invention, innovation and creation throughout Europe (Evers and Laville, 2004) was not simply a forerunner of the âreal thingâ in the form of state-based social security and service system; rather, it entailed a voluntary, not-for-profit and community sector that has, right up until the present day, included an important role for social innovation. Therefore, when discussing potential links between social innovation and welfare, welfare systems and welfare mixes (Evers and Wintersberger, 1990; Evers and Guillemard, 2012; Jenson, 2012 and in this volume) that encompass this third sector should be seen as the framework of reference and not just state action alone. Second, strategies that want to give more space for social innovation have to rethink the balance between equality and diversity. In various ways, historical welfare policies have sought to ensure greater equality in society. It is generally agreed that all people should have access to the same institutions and facilities, whether in health, social support services or education. Standards should be guaranteed in both urban and rural areas, and the same quality and procedural standards should ensure that this is always the case. This idea of equal provision was primarily linked with hierarchical systems of decision-making and administration."

One of the most burdensome tasks is (6) to assemble and utilize existing tool-sets for collecting the necessary information and actually controlling power-knobs. It requires the user to pay much cost and time to consider these tasks. Our framework is designed to provide or to support the following functionalities which help users and administrators carry out power management/control effectively without taking care of the above mentioned issues: â Analyzing source code and applying automatic instrumentation â Measuring and controlling application power consumption and performance â Optimizing an application under given power budget â Specifying and defining the target machine specification â Calibrating hardware power consumption of the system The outline of the framework is presented in Fig. 2. One of the benefit of the framework is the fact that workflow of power-performance optimization and control can be specified in higher abstraction level. Details of how to use libraries for controlling power-knobs, how to profile and analyze the application code, and how to instrument power management pragmas in the code or the job submission script are hidden from users. Moreover, the framework provides high modularity and flexibility so that libraries or tool-set used in the framework and also power optimization algorithms are customizable. In order to provide customizability and flexibility, we developed a simple DSL as the front-end for these supported tools and for selecting the power optimization algorithm. Note that in current version of the framework, we support RAPL/cpufreq utils for accessing power-knobs [9,19] and TAU/PDT for code"

The consequences of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea may ultimately be an ecological regime shift â i.e. a situation where the ecosystem shifts from one relatively stable state to another with unknown thresholds between the states â with associated risks of detrimental effects on ecosystem services and an unknown degree of resilience (Ãsterblom et al. 2010; Ãsterblom et al. 2007). Traditionally, the governance approach toenvironmental problems and risks has presupposed that various phenomena in natural systems can rationally be dealt with by straightforward science-based management (Linke et al. 2016). The basis for this view has been a reductionist scientific approach, within an international framework of environmental governance, fragmented into sectors and countries and divided into national and international levels (Mee 2005). For example, fisheries and agri-"
347,278,0.208,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The five cases of environmental governance studied in this project have been identified as key large-scale environmental problems and risks in the Baltic Sea (see Gilek et al. 2016; HELCOM 2010): fisheries, eutrophication, invasive alien species, chemical pollution and oil discharges linked to marine transportation. However, as revealed throughout the previous chapters, they differ substantially in terms of the complexity of risk sources, the available knowledge and the uncertainties connected to assessing environmental effects for advising decision-making, as well as with respect to the degrees of ambiguity and sociopolitical controversy involved in policy and management (Gilek et al. 2011). In this chapter, we investigate the interactions between risk assessment (science) and risk management (policy) in the five different cases. We analyse and compare these interactions using a theoretical framework on science-policy interfaces described in Sect. 8.2. Specifically, we study how organisational structures and processes of science-policy interactions adapt to key challenges of science and management in environmental governance by focusing on different forms of uncertainty, as well as on stakeholder conflicts and disagreements involved in science and/versus policy in the five cases. We also trace the respective management reactions to these challenges in each of the cases using a typology of different kinds of incomplete knowledge and their consequences for management responses as described below (Sect. 8.2.2). Through this comparative study of science-policy interfaces across the five cases, we point out institutional and procedural hindrances, challenges and prospects for improving science-policy interactions for a more effective and sustainable environmental governance of the Baltic Sea. Following the discussion on our theoretical framework, we present the results of our analysis of the five science-policy interfaces (Sect. 8.3). The two sections thereafter discuss the outcomes of the study (Sect. 8.4) and provide conclusions and recommendations (Sect. 8.5), respectively."

The clickstream logs show negligible use of the âSAVE_SOCIAL_TAGâ action. For the period JuneâDecember 2012 (the only period for which we have clickstream logs) the action occurred 189 times. Set against 9.6 million accesses to object pages (FULL_RESULT_HTML) and 4.8 million presentations of search results (BRIEF_RESULT:search), and 1.6 views of the homepage (INDEXPAGE) it is clear that not much sharing goes on; so insignificant that we need to look for another definition of âsocial media sharingâ. If we turn to the Google Analytics equivalent, âSocial Pluginsâ, the numbers are still low, but better: September 2012âMarch 2013, 3,945 âUnique Social Actionsâ.

But the actual numbers are very small, in fact of the 142 Social sharing sources used by all visitors only threeâFacebook, Google+, and Twitterâappear when the report is restricted to âsocial segmentâ referrals.

284,14,0.208,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Environmental governance as a ï¬eld of inquiry Environmental governance offers an analytical perspective that combines socioenvironmental research with development-oriented governance research (Lemos and Agrawal, 2006). Socioenvironmental research addresses the interplay between environmental and social change. In this context, as in this introductory chapter, the social dimension is broadly deï¬ned, also encompassing cultural, economic, political and institutional relations. Governance research addresses the way in which society organizes itself in order to solve its dilemmas and create new opportunities. Until the 1980s, social scientists working in Latin American countries focused on concepts of governability as the region faced unstable political conditions and structural challenges such as inequality, violence, corruption and limited citizenship. However, the growing emphasis on formal institutions and market-driven mechanisms of neoliberal governance quickly attracted the attention of social scientists to a perspective of governance as a social process that inï¬uences the level of governability (Kooiman, 2003). This perspective criticized the normative perspective of âgood governanceâ introduced by the World Bank in the seminal report Governance and Development (1992). According to this document, the solution to overcome underdevelopment should be self-governance. The World Bank proposed a roadmap to achieve so-called good governance based on three pillars: a âsmall stateâ through deregulation; âmarket incentivesâ though privatization and liberalization; and âparticipationâ through decentralization and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Subsequent World Bank reports further elaborated this international agenda, stressing in a rather technocratic approach, the need for effective state institutions to achieve development in a global context of liberalized markets (Demmers, FernÃ¡ndez Jilberto and Hogenboom, 2004). Alternatively, social science scholars use (environmental) governance to emphasize social relations and, in particular, the tension between conservation and development goals in order to understand the interplay among social, institutional and environmental change. The environmental governance research builds on a range of theoretical schools, including new institutionalism (Ostrom, 1990; Young, 1999; Biermann and Pattberg, 2008), sociopolitical studies (Kooiman et al., 2005; Lemos and Agrawal, 2006) and sociocultural approaches (Cleaver, 2002; Alimonda and GandÃ¡segui, 2006; Castro, 2008; Gudynas, 2011). Despite their different theoretical and methodological stands (see Castro, 2013), they all address social behaviour towards natural"
72,294,0.207,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Introduction India has seen a recent and rapid emergence of social enterprise as a potential alternative development channel. Social enterprises, defined in this chapter as organisations that combine a focus on financial sustainability with an explicit commitment to social impact through their products and/or employment and sourcing strategies, offer new and innovative ways of providing goods, services and livelihood opportunities for the poor. In other words, social enterprise is a hybrid â operating with the social impact objectives of an NGO and the market-driven financial aims of a for-profit firm. Social enterprise, therefore, involves the reconfiguring of social relations between the private sector market and civil society (Allen et al., 2012; Koh et al., 2012). Innovation is central in social enterprises in emerging markets because many are creating new products and services, as well as accessing and, at times, creating new markets and value chains (Koh et al., 2014; Rajan, 2013). However, to innovate and grow their social enterprises, entrepreneurs need to interact with other actors, including fellow entrepreneurs, suppliers, wholesalers, investors and incubators. They do so to access new information and knowledge, new sources of finance, new business connections along the value chain and new markets and customers. Social enterprises in and around Indiaâs major cities (including Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi) can increasingly rely on a range of support organisations to help them grow and flourish, including investors, incubators and networking platforms, as highlighted in a number of recent reports (Saltuk et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2012). However, accessing such financial and non-financial support can be difficult, especially outside of the large cities, as there are few formal mechanisms to connect"

169,638,0.207,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"21.6.1 Integration of the ES Approach into the WFD Although the ES concept is not yet explicitly mentioned in the EU Water Framework Directive, the aspect of ensuring the provision of ES is implicitly linked with the WFD objective of âreaching a good ecological statusâ (Wallis et al. 2011). The following WFD articles speciï¬cally refer to the valuation of ES (based on Wallis et al. 2011): â Article 5: assessment of the economic signiï¬cance of water use, current level of cost recovery â Article 4: decisions on derogations â Article 9: assessment of the level of cost recovery and incentive pricing â Article 11: selection of the most cost-effective sets of measures for achieving good ecological status/potential for the programs of measures The clear linkage between the WFD and its principles and the ecosystem approach is also shown by Vlachopoulou et al. (2014). They argue that it has the potential to act in a complementary way. It could, for instance, be applied for the evaluation of different management scenarios and thereby support decision-making processes. In particular, the more holistic management approaches that are supported by the ES approach, such as the spatial mapping of ES or the comprehensive evaluation of multiple beneï¬ts, can potentially assist in achieving the goals of the WFD (Vlachopoulou et al. 2014). In this context, Koundouri et al. (2015) propose an integrated methodology that regards the ES approach as the core aspect to achieve a more sustainable and efï¬cient water management. It combines the ES framework with traditional economic frameworks and consists of a socioeconomic characterization of the river basin area, an assessment of water use costs that are recovered, and a suggestion for appropriate measures for sustainable water management. In order to enhance the WFD implementation, Reyjol et al. (2014) established a list of research needs that also includes the reinforcement of the knowledge on relationships between good ecological status, biodiversity, and ES. They recommend enhancing understanding of ecological processes through developing further research on the links between good ecological status, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. As the ES concept is still not very well known among water policymakers and managers, they point to the need for easily comprehensible guidelines for these actor groups."
99,488,0.206,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"social innovation was not an explicit priority in this city, it was met with sympathy even when it challenged dominant views in the political sphere. The concept was linked to actions of limited scope as offshoots of mainstream programmes, as a way to expand social action without expanding or containing direct public provision. Another example was the city of MalmÃ¶ in Sweden (Carrigan and Nordfeldt 2014). Innovation was made a key discursive concept in the policy arena around local welfare in MalmÃ¶. Political actors considered the concept a cross-political one and used it in the hope of attracting people and organisations from various ideological backgrounds. In both these cities, the concept of social innovation was supported by varied political coalitions, albeit for different reasons. At the same time, other social innovations among the case studies in the WILCO project were limited in their development because others downplayed the contested nature of their work or because they were bogged down by local political conflicts. It was sometimes impossible to distinguish successful from failed cases because there was no consensus on what their goals should have been. In the case of neighbourhood revitalization innovation in Zagreb, for example, a lack of coordination between local government offices and local city companies affected the visibility of the innovation in a negative manner (Bezovan et al. 2014b). Public strategies or social marketing were consequently not on the agenda due to political conflicts, including an unstable political situation, resignation of a mayor and local elections. Another example of political conflicts disabling social innovations was found in the city of VaraÅ¾din (Bezovan et al. 2013). The role and recognition of civil society in the development of social innovation has strengthened over time. However, as argued in the research, political turbulence and changes to power structures hindered the development of more systematic cooperation from being established. There are examples of cities and local contexts, such as Lille, in which the local political arena for social innovation remains weakened by attention paid to a limited number of other priorities due to economic crisis and budget cuts (Fraisse and Bia Zafinikamia 2013). There are also cities, such as MalmÃ¶, in which local political disagreements hindered the implementation of particular innovations (see Chap. 6 in this book). Even though there was political consensus about the need for new solutions in local welfare in general and the promotion of social innovation as a concept in particular, different stakeholders and coalitions disagreed regarding the methods and instruments to be implemented, affecting the emergence and development of social innovations. If the practice of social innovations has more to do with changes in social relations than products or processes, they are necessarily also conflict-ridden and political by nature. Those who claim to study the phenomenon with any seriousness must at least incorporate this much. Resistance and opposition, risks and dangers, as well as negative effects and misuse need to be taken seriously, regardless of the normative good of social innovations (Borins 2001). Such conflicts are rarely discussed in the current mainstream of social innovation literature. Ironically, in its denial of politics, social innovation literature is profoundly political. Being aware of the local context and by implication of the local politics was one of the hallmarks of the WILCO projectâs approach."
188,146,0.206,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Conclusion and Future Work Developing an evaluation framework for PLEs is challenging, since technological, organizational, psycho-pedagogical and social aspects need to be considered in an integrated manner and with a diverse set of stakeholder perspectives being taken into account. Our attempt was to propose a unified framework encompassing the main valid constructs (derived from relevant theoretical models), yet at the same time providing a flexible and adaptive methodology that is capable of accommodating the changes that are inevitable in an emerging field. In order to achieve this, we have elaborated an integrated framework that is by nature case study based and follows a multi-method approach. Furthermore, we recommended concluding the cyclic evaluation with a cross-case analysis in order to consolidate data from different contexts so as to establish a holistic view. A number of metrics and possible methods have been identified and located in the proposed unified framework. The metrics, criteria, methods, techniques, and tools proposed are subjected to further refinement and improvement. A process model ensures the possibility to do so in a well-defined manner. Obviously, more research efforts are called for to investigate the complex phenomenon of PLEâand this contribution provides the methodological basis on which such future endeavors can be built.

271,45,0.206,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"Beyond detailed research results, existing studies on mediatization agree that any process of mediatization is very specific in relation to the social domain under consideration. This term social domain is used by various representatives of mediatization research (amongst others Hjarvard 2013; EkstrÃ¶m et al. 2016; Lunt and Livingstone 2016), while coming close to the everyday understanding of âspheresâ of society. In its widest sense, the term âsocial domainâ refers to those âspheresâ as being meaningful in everyday practice. The scaling of the different âmeaningful domainsâ can be very different, reaching from certain social groups or organizations to whole social fields or systems. We can understand this scaling to be a problem of terminological blurriness. However, the main argument being pushed forward in mediatization research is different. By hinting at the domain specificity of mediatization, scholars want to emphasize the variety of mediatization across different spheres of society. Mediatization is not a homogeneous process but very much differs from one area to another. It is a âdomain-specificâ phenomenon. We can understand this as taking up a long tradition in social sciences relating to the idea of âsocialâ as well as âculturalâ differentiation (Winter and Eckert 1990: 142â151; Hahn 2000: 14â24; Schimank 2013: 37â50; 131â149). Max Weber, for example, used the term WertsphÃ¤ren (Weber 1988 [1919]: 611) to reflect this. Pierre Bourdieu (1993) described processes of differentiation by analyzing differences within and across âsocial fieldsâ. Roger Friedland and Robert Alford (1991) preferred the idea of âinstitutional fieldsâ. In system theory, we find the concept of âsubsystemâ (Luhmann 2012, Vol. 2: 4â27), a term which was also used by JÃ¼rgen Habermas (1992) to describe social differentiation. In a similar vein, phenomenology puts emphasis on different (small) âlife-worldsâ (SchÃ¼tz 1967: 139â144; Luckmann 1970: 587), with a certain relationship to the âsocial worldsâ of symbolic interactionism (Shibutani 1955: 566; Strauss 1978; Clarke 2011: 384â385). More recently, Luc Boltanski and Laurent ThÃ©venot (2006) proposed the idea of different âorders of justificationâ."

293,10,0.204,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","sending states in immigration and integration processes. In that sense, this book should be understood as a state-of-the-art volume that takes stock of and presents existing knowledge to assess the relevance of incorporating the sending states into analyses of immigrantsâ integration processes and policies. In line with recent approaches to the concept of integration, Chap. 2 by Penninx and GarcÃ©s-MascareÃ±as sets up an analytical framework for the study of integration processes and policies. The first part focuses on the concept of integration, introducing an open, non-normative analytical definition and identifying the main dimensions, parties involved, levels of analysis, and other relevant factors such as time and generations. The second part defines integration policies and proposes a distinction between policy frames and concrete policy measures as well as a shift from government to governance so as to account for the complex, multilayered and often contradictory character of integration policies. In the broader context of this book, the analytical framework proposed in this chapter leads us to a twofold conclusion: the concept of integration and integration policies is made dramatically more complex, in particular, by taking a disaggregated approach that considers not only multiple reference populations but also distinct processes occurring in different dimensions and domains. At the same time, immigrantsâ integration continues to be seen essentially as a two-way process involving the immigrants themselves and the receiving society. In Chap. 3, Van Mol and De Valk provide a general background to help us to understand the first key actor of the abovementioned binomial, that is, the immigrants themselves. In particular, the authors analyse the main socio-demographic changes in migration patterns towards and within Europe since the 1950s. Making use of secondary literature and available statistical data, they first describe the main phases in immigration, its backgrounds and determinants, depending on immigrantsâ origins and reasons to migrate and with regard to different European regions. In the second part of the chapter, the authors narrow the focus to the specificities of recent patterns of mobility within Europe. Analysing both migration flows and the residing migrant population across Europe, they distinguish different sociodemographic characteristics of migrants depending on countries of origin and destination. For instance, while Polish migration to Germany seems to be dominated by men aged between 20 and 50 years old, Polish immigrants in the Netherlands are significantly younger and more equally balanced in terms of gender. The analysis of intra-European mobility shows that in North-Western Europe (e.g., in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands) intra-European migrants account for more than the half of total immigration, meaning that a substantial proportion of new immigrants falls outside those categorized as target groups of EU integration policies. The subsequent three chapters focus on the second actor of the binomial, that is, the receiving society, particularly the characteristics and main developments of immigration and integration policies. In Chap. 4, Doomernik and Bruquetas-Callejo distinguish between different immigration and integration policy regimes in Europe. The first is that of North-Western European countries, which evolved from guest worker policies that considered immigrants only as temporary workers to national integration policies that recognize them as permanent citizens and, more recently, to"

46,113,0.203,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"processes. This certainly has implications for social policy: benefits alone will not be enough to solve the problem of social exclusion. The fact that social exclusion is a relational concept poses another issue and shows that social relations are of utmost importance. Inclusion and exclusion are processes that unfold through the interactions within certain social environments and contexts and reshape the opportunities persons have. There is a link between the main assumption of the capability approach, namely that capabilities and functionings are dependent on different conversion factors, and this relational dimension of social inclusion/exclusion. Being excluded means to be cut off from important conversion factors other people have access to as well. Social inclusion/exclusion is also more of a process than a static concept (Millar 2007). One is included through activities, doing certain things on a regularly basis and being part of social groups. Social inclusion is therefore not a functioning one can acquire at a certain point in time and keep without putting constant effort into it. Social inclusion has also a spatial dimension; where children live and how their neighborhood and environment look have a great influence on what they can do and have and on what kind of relations they can have to other people (MacDonald and Marsh 2005). Social inclusion has two sides, an internal and an external one. The external side can be evaluated by looking at what children in poverty are actually doing and having; the internal side, on the other hand, has an emotional aspect and refers to the actual feeling and knowing that one is included and accepted. The concept of respect and the functioning of being respected as a human of equal worth, which we will discuss later in this chapter, also comes into play here. Both the internal and external dimension of social inclusion are fertile: the internal dimension is closely related to self-efficacy and other positive self-relations of selftrust and self-esteem, which in turn are fertile for the development and achievement of other capabilities and functionings â children that have them are more likely to explore their potentials and try to succeed. The external dimension of social inclusion is fertile because having social relations and being accepted and recognized by others and in the social world one lives in gives a child much more valuable options and makes it easier to realize them. Social inclusion is important if a child needs help; for example, if she struggles at school or if she has problems with her parents; it is important in later life because it can provide networks and is a form of social capital that has been shown to be beneficial especially for economic status (Pichler and Wallace 2008). Hence, social inclusion in capability terms refers to the ability to achieve functionings and capabilities as a child that are viewed as"

Second, these people do not float in a global space, but need to touch ground from time to time (Ley 2004). An analysis of transnationalism as an everyday phenomenon needs, therefore, to take into account the localities where the social practice that constitutes these relations and communications across borders, takes place. Locality therefore represents, on the one hand, the social context in which migrants and other transnational actors are rooted, and it stands, on the other hand, for the nodes of the networks (Gielis 2009). Some authors have called such places translocal because they are meaningful owing to their connection across national borders (Brickell and Datta 2011; Smith 2011). Third, these localities need to be connected somehow to become translocal. Such connections have been addressed conceptually through the study of networks (Featherstone 2007; Featherstone et al. 2007). Fourth, the spatial formation that is constituted through the networks of people and places and the practices that maintain them have been termed transnational social spaces (Pries 2008; Faist 2009). Transnational studies confront researchers with a social phenomenon that is complex, because it is, on the one hand, spatially disrupted, and on the other hand, highly connected in social terms. Researchers have developed various approaches to deal with this complexity. One of the earliest and most cited is the notion of multi-sited research that was discussed prominently by Marcus (1995). The idea of following people, things, metaphors, stories, biographies, or conflicts has been used in various studies in the field of transnational migration (Amelina 2010; Sinatti 2011). Nevertheless, some scholars criticize that these research strategies are seldom truly multi-, but rather, double-sited and that it seems impossible to conduct an equally intensive ethnography in multiple sites (Hage 2005). The problem of conducting parallel ethnographies has, for instance, been addressed by Mazzucato (2010: 206) with her âsimultaneous matched samples.â While being resource-intensive, the advantage of conducting research simultaneously at two sites by two connected groups of researchers provides accounts of simultaneity that cannot be apprehended otherwise. Other researchers, such as Tarrius, have stressed the aspect of movement and created a moving ethnography (Tarrius 2000; Tarrius 2002). This leads also to mobile methods: â[A] mobile ethnography involves travelling with people and things, participating in their continual shift through time, place and relations with othersâ (Watts and Urry 2008: 867). The âmoving territoriesâ Tarrius (2001) evokes, point towards the tensions that lie at the heart of research on transnationalism: the ambivalence between fixing people and places (territories) and their constant movement. All these approaches have in common, that they obtain rich data by a variety of methods. The research strategy we are presenting here is also a mixed-methods approach that bridges the spatial disruption and grasps the notions of movement and fixity that are always competing in these studies. A comparison with items measuring the characteristics of social networks in quantitative household panel data exemplifies the reasoning behind our approach. Of course, social capital as a resource and social network data have also gained importance in recent years in quantitative research. For instance, the Swiss household panel, includes a variety of items to grasp the extent of a householdâs network and can be used for analysis of social support (see for instance Bachmann 2014). However, the data are unsuitable for our question for"
72,176,0.203,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Innovations in governance The social innovations that were studied all represented a combination of new social âproductsâ and new social âprocessesâ, the latter term referring to the internal organisation of decision-making and interaction with the environment, the public, various stakeholders, social partners and political and administrative authorities. Many social innovations that sought to develop new kinds of services also had a novel governance dimension. However, for some innovations, influencing and changing the system of governance was found to be their core focus. This was the case, for example, in Bern, Switzerland (Evers et al., 2014, p. 355), where new integration guidelines that became mandatory for public stakeholders were worked out in a cooperative process by a group of administrators, experts and representatives of local NGOs. Fostering units and types of organisation that operate in a more embedded and networked way Traditional service organisations and systems focus very much on their respective special tasks, effectively functioning in silos (Boyle et al., 2010). This limited degree of cooperation and sharing also applies, however, in those parts of the service landscape that have been shaped by managerial reforms. Social innovations, by contrast, are characterised by bringing together what is usually separate, whether this is ideas, concerns or practices. Since the social innovations that were studied have a highly localised character, they were much more embedded than organisations that were part of a hierarchical system, whether in business or in centralised welfare administrations. A good example of an unconventional form of networking was the âNeighbourhood Stores for Education, Research, and Talent Developmentâ in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Evers et al., 2014, p. 208), where teachers and students"
3,65,0.203,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"2.4.1.3.1 Theoretical Background The knowledge integration framework was built off of the knowledge in pieces theory (diSessa, 1988), the anchored instruction framework (The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990), situated learning in collaborative groups (Brown & Campione, 1994; Lave & Wenger, 1991), and research that suggests that learning outcomes in science instruction would be best served when one focuses on a smaller number of core concepts (Bierman, Massey, & Manduca, 2006; Eylon & Linn, 1988). These perspectives are explained in the paragraphs that follow. According to the knowledge in pieces theory, students come to school having developed intuitive theories of how physical objects behave under particular circumstances; some of these mini-theories come close to describing phenomena of interest accurately, while others are farther away from describing said phenomena accurately (diSessa, 1988; Taber, 2008). Such mini-theories are not developed as most theories areâthrough careful reflection on a variety of observations in light of other research and theories. Rather, they are âabstractions from common experiencesââsuch as the idea that force can move objects (diSessa, 1988, p. 3). These mini-theories do not together constitute a larger, more comprehensive theory. Furthermore, students do not have the right pieces of knowledge to together explain how physical objects behave in a scientifically accurate way. Some research has suggested that such incomplete mini-theories do not necessarily prompt the teaching of correct information to replace the existing mini-theories (Spada, 1994). Rather, instruction needs to help fill in the gaps in studentsâ knowledge (diSessa, 1988). In anchored instruction, studentsâ learning is centered in an authentic problem situation, which prompts students to define and pursue learning issues (Bransford,"
191,479,0.202,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Holism is a central aspect of social work because all children, young people and adults are part of a whole, of something bigger than the individual. A holistic approach is based on the understanding that the problems of a child or young person cannot be viewed separately from the rest of the individual (EjrnÃ¦s and Guldager 2008; Guldager 2015). Working holistically means working with all the aspects of a personâs life that are important to a case, based on the assumption that all the aspects are interconnected (Harder 2011). Not all elements are equally important, but they are all significant and nothing can deliberately be left out. A holistic approach is by definition multidisciplinary, as one profession cannot be profoundly knowledgeable about all the aspects of a case (Guldager 2015). Holism is central to social work, as explained in the words of Ferguson, because social work includes the combination of a value base of respect, empowerment and social justice, the emphasis on a relationship between worker and service user founded on trust and non-judgmental acceptance; a knowledge base which embraces both developmental psychology and also an understanding of social structures and social procedures, and a repertoire of methods ranging from individual counselling to advocacy and community work; all these give social work a holistic perspective which makes it unique among the helping professions (Ferguson 2008)."
99,203,0.202,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Debates about social innovation have given rise to a large body of literature in the social sciences. The concept itself is ambiguous and has become a confusing âbuzzwordâ, as underlined by Moulaert et al. (2013, p. 13): In our opinion, the lack of clarity about the term âsocial innovationâ can be attributed not only to its evolving analytical status but also to its over-simplistic use as a buzzword in a multiplicity of policy practices associated, for example, with the rationalization of the welfare state and the commodification of sociocultural wellbeing. The appropriation of the term by âcaring liberalismâ, in one of its new incarnations, has added to a Babel-like terminological confusion. (Moulaert et al. 2013, p. 13)"
309,424,0.202,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"1. The concept of âfood social spaceâ describes the social dimensions of food. It corresponds to the area of freedom left to human eaters by two sets of physical constraints: biological constraints related to their status as omnivores, which are essential but relatively flexible, and the ecological constraints created by the biotope in which they live, which become economic constraints in the industrialised world and which progressively tend to be reduced due to our technological control of nature (Poulain 2017 [2002]). âFood social spaceâ is in line with the Maussian notion of a âtotal social factâ, that is, which âsets in motion â¦ the totality of the society and its institutionsâ (Mauss 1950). It is possible to distinguish various dimensions of social food space: the edible order, the food system, the culinary space, the consumption patterns, food temporality and the social differentiation space. Its main interests are to show the variations of the social dimensions of food between two cultures and in the frame of one culture, and to study the interaction between social and biological infrastructure of nutrition as well as the environment (for a systematic presentation see Poulain 2017 [2002])."
72,154,0.201,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"strategies for prompting, promoting and supporting social innovations in the market. They have turned to social entrepreneurs to alter patterns of demand and supply in labour markets. The hope is to improve labour supply by funding and promoting social enterprises engaged in training and retraining the hard-to-employ, those excluded from the labour market or those without the necessary skills. Social policy communities have also sought to increase demand for workers by supporting the creation of many types of social enterprises that provide, often in the welfare and environmental sectors, for needs that go unmet or services that are not equally accessible when only commercial firms are active in their provision. They have also turned to social entrepreneurs to provide the key services identified by the social investment perspective for modern social policy. These are not only employment services but also childcare that serves the double function of enabling parental labour market participation and, even more importantly from this perspective, adequate investments in human capital from the pre-school years onwards via accessible and high-quality early education and care. Social innovations, especially social entrepreneurship and quasimarkets, are now and increasingly presented as positive ways to do social interventions, avoiding the limits of both âbig businessâ driven by profitseeking and âbig governmentâ driven by the practices and controls of Weberian-style public administrations. Thus, as the claims increasingly go, effective social investments will be more likely, at least to be identified and first implemented, if they are left to these market-making and market-modelled innovators. A range of mechanisms and policy instruments have been deployed across different jurisdictions, but many share the characteristic that they allow the market corner of the welfare diamond to expand by becoming more active in the provision of services. One key way that this move has been undertaken â usually at the local level â is by providing public funds for provision of what might have been or used to be public services. Thus, community-based social entrepreneurs have increasingly provided employment integration services or immigration integration services which in the past â if provided â were usually public. Similarly, as childcare services have increased significantly in number and the amount of public spending on them has risen concomitantly, the dominant position of public provision has given way to a multitude of market-based actors often operating as social enterprises in many countries. Such changes constitute significant change in the relations between state and civil society and within civil society itself."

However, it has been impossible to implement such a programme in these countries, as there is neither willingness nor need for volunteer work. So in this case, it can be clearly stated that social innovation emerged from civil engagement and volunteer work of citizens, as a kind of collective action (Habisch and Loza Adaui 2013), making effort to protect and promote their interests."

The Global South is both experiencing phenomenal development in some places (with the attendant environmental and social challenges) and still facing deep poverty and hunger. Some of this is, in turn, partly but never exclusively related to socio-demographic changes, including ageing societies virtually everywhere around the world, and increases in lone-parent families (ILO, 2011). Global population flows, whether from the Global South northward or within the European Union from poorer to richer member states (whether from east to west or north to south), are also creating new wealth for some and precariousness, poverty and even misery for others (Dustmann and Frattini, 2011). Historically marginalised groups facing prejudice â Aboriginal peoples in many countries and Roma almost everywhere they live â find their lives increasingly difficult (UN, 2009; European Commission, 2011a). Many of these changes can be summarised under the label of ânew social risksâ (Bonoli and Natali, 2012). The structure of these new risks challenges previous configurations of the welfare diamond and associated social policy programmes, practices and ideas about the proper and possible balance of spaces for markets, states, families and communities. In effect, the market corner of the welfare diamond is being exhorted by social policy communities to expand, by recognising the contributions of â and contributing towards â the social economy and social entrepreneurship more generally. But often practices of social innovation also include reworking both the responsibilities of the community corner of the diamond and aligning it in ground-breaking ways with respect to the market. As it does so, social innovationâs status as a quasi-concept is very clear. Numerous ways of understanding it co-exist as markets are re-imagined."
72,215,0.197,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Whereas both the Reinventing Government movement and the attempt to spur technological innovation in the public sector focussed on a combination of organisational and process innovation, the recent emphasis on social innovation has shifted the innovation agenda in the direction of service and policy innovation. Social innovation emerged as a concept in British and French debates in the 1960s and 1970s but was only recently embraced by the European Commission, which described it as âinnovations that are both social in their ends and in their meansâ (European Commission, 2010). The scholarly definition of social innovation varies, but one of the authoritative sources defined it as âinnovative activities and services that are motivated by the goal of meeting a social need and that are predominantly developed and diffused through organisations whose primary purpose are socialâ (Mulgan et al., 2007, p. 8). There are two important novelties in this definition of social innovation. First, the purpose of innovating is not merely to make the public sector more efficient but rather to develop new programmes and services that aim to meet unmet social needs. Second, innovation is not created merely by actors and processes internal to the public sector but involves deliberative attempts to tap into the creativity of charities, associations and social entrepreneurs in order to find new ways of meeting pressing social needs. The notion of âsocial innovationâ has not caught on to the same extent in all Western countries, and the discourse on social innovation appears to be stronger in the Anglo-Saxon countries than in continental Europe, despite the attempts of the European Commission to promote social innovation as an important response to the economic and social crisis in Europe (European Commission, 2010; 2013a; 2013b; BEPA, 2010). However, the underlying idea that public innovation should both seek to make the public sector more efficient by reforming administrative processes and organisational designs and serve a social purpose by fostering new and better policies and services is shared by policy makers, public managers and public employees in many European countries (European Commission, 2013b). As such, the key question is no longer whether the public sector should aim to spur innovation in policy, services and organisational designs in order to enhance the production of social and public value but, rather, how this can be done."
164,126,0.196,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","social and cultural cohesion and adaptive abilities have been lost, preventing the rebuilding of society (Volkan 2000). In the case of ârigidity traps,â decision circuits are highly interconnected, reinforcing themselves and making the system inflexible (Gunderson and Holling 2002). A good example is an old forest where larger, wellestablished trees inhibit the growth of saplings, impeding the renewal of the forest as a whole and increasing vulnerability to disturbances such as wildfire (Carpenter and Brock 2008). A corresponding social example would be the case of authoritarian governments where vertical decision-making structures impede innovation and adaptation, that tend to collapse when the overall settings such as democratic values become gradually hegemonic. Preventing the marginalization of a human community by increasing its resilience and adaptive capacity cannot be achieved by concentrating on a single component without considering other interlinked components of the SES. Contrarily it must fulfill various complementary and successive goals (e.g., guaranteeing food security, creating income generating opportunities, and maintaining ecosystem services)â goals which aim at improving the conditions for living systems, either social or ecological. In consequence any intervention to prevent and eventually reduce marginality should consider the functionality of the components of the SES and the involved processes. Moreover these efforts need to acknowledge the complexity of SES and therefore adopt systemic principles that allow the identification and characterization of the components, and consideration of the context, boundaries, connectedness, feedback, inflows and outflows as proposed by the âEcosystem Approachâ (Waltner-Toews et al. 2008), and further elaborated by Gatzweiler et al. (2011) in the context of social marginality."

Hence, the adaptation of management needs to be included in a broader assessment framework to be useful in a decision-making context. This framework should comprise methods to compare scenario results as well as methods to evaluate options and prioritise actions. Risk management is suggested as one tool to provide this framework (e.g. Rannow 2011, 2013; Lorenzoni et al. 2005; Willows and Connell 2003). âStress testsâ that help to identify critical changes and thresholds for resilience of ecosystems might be another tool (Brown and Wilby 2012)."
72,150,0.195,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"perspectiveâ has taken over more and more of social policy discourse.17 Where the social investment perspective has been implemented, new public spending has been made and services have been expanded. And indeed, these social investment interventions continued even during the first five years of the economic crisis (Kvist, 2013). However, much of this growth has been achieved via reliance on social enterprises, considered to be most innovative. The social investment perspective on modernising social policy18 diagnoses the challenges facing families with children and prescribes strategies to increase parental employment as well as to provide services focussed on the human capital of children in order to âbreak the intergenerational cycle of disadvantageâ.19 The social policy analysis underpinning the social investment perspective rests on two main themes (Esping-Andersen et al., 2002; Jenson, 2012). The first is that it is better for children that their parents are employed than that the family is workless. Following from this perspective, lone mothers and underemployed mothers are a prime target for integration into the labour force and, therefore, as clients of the work integration enterprises described above. The second theme is that the emerging knowledgebased economy requires significant investment in human capital and that this must begin with the youngest children and early childhood education. This focus is examined here. Childcare services have expanded significantly across Europe, with stable or greater public financing of childcare services between 1998 and 2009 in every European country except Luxembourg (OECD, 2014, PF3.1). Nonetheless, while spending increased or remained at least stable, many jurisdictions reduced or limited their own direct service provision and provided incentives to social enterprises to organise services. Thus, public funding has gone to non-public actors to develop services needed to implement the social investment perspective. For example, Sweden is a country often identified as an early adopter of the social investment perspective (Esping-Andersen et al., 2002). In the 1980s it began to innovate in forms of service provision in the name of âchoiceâ (Blomqvist, 2004).20 With respect to services for children, this involved reducing the dominant position of the municipal childcare centre, which had been virtually the only form of service provision used when the system expanded from the 1960s.21 In the 1980s, Sweden turned to parental and personnel cooperatives to broaden the variety of childcare (Duane-Richard and Mahon, 2001). By the 1990s, the range of providers widened again. Changes to legislation at the time meant that most municipalities would continue to provide services directly,"
72,328,0.195,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Conclusion This chapter set out to improve the understanding of how innovative social enterprises use networks. In spite of coming from very different backgrounds, all the social entrepreneurs found that their networks changed substantially over time. In the beginning they generally relied more heavily on family and friends, while later they had more professional contacts on board, whether as mentors, investors and/or Board members. It was striking how important the social entrepreneurs found the connection to other social entrepreneurs as a source of day-to-day support and best practice advice. The impact of individual networks went beyond the individual social entrepreneurs to affect the wider social enterprise ecosystem by multiplying through network platforms and creating large networks of actors within the social enterprise ecosystem, such as the Jagriti Yatra network or the Dasra cohort network. The case studies highlighted that entrepreneurs starting from very different backgrounds can gain access to support that enables them to become financially sustainable social enterprises. Nevertheless, the case studies also showed that it can be difficult to access support for those not based in one of Indiaâs major cities, where the social enterprise support ecosystem is concentrated. Further, there is a bias towards the use of English among the organisations providing financial and non-financial support for social entrepreneurs (such as incubators and impact investors).

72,357,0.194,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Constraint and opportunity The barriers faced by the social innovation movement, pursued under its maximalist understanding, are many and formidable. Mankind remains almost everywhere bent under the yoke of the dictatorship of no alternatives. The hegemonic project in the rich North Atlantic region â the reconciliation of European-style social protection within American-style economic flexibility, undertaken as an accommodation of the mid-20th century institutional and ideological settlement to present economic realities â excludes more ambitious innovations even if advanced by fragmentary and gradualist means. Outside the North Atlantic region, the major emerging powers have little to show by way of alternatives other than state capitalism, combined with pieces of neoliberalism and compensatory social democracy. Their potential for spiritual rebellion and institutional invention continues to be suppressed under the burdens of a mental colonialism that their increasing power makes all the more surprising. The most insidious opposition, however, comes from the high academic culture, in which the social innovators might have expected to find friends. There, across the whole range of social and historical studies, tendencies of thought prevail that would, if they were to be believed, deny authority to what the innovators seek to accomplish. In the hard, positive social sciences â beginning with the most influential, economics â rationalisation predominates: a way of explaining present arrangements that justifies their superiority or inevitability by suggesting that they are the outcome of a cumulative convergence to best practice.

As human populations grow and encroach on remaining bat habitat, humanâbat interactions are increasing, often with negative consequences for both parties through disease relationships (Schneeberger and Voigt 2016), occupation of human dwellings (Voigt et al. 2016), and conflict over fruit crops (Abdul Aziz et al. 2015). The Anthropocene is named for us, and solutions to our environmental problems rest with us, as Mascia et al. (2003) so concisely put it: âBiodiversity conservation is a human endeavor: initiated by humans, designed by humans, and intended to modify human behaviorââ(Mascia et al. 2003, p. 650). Bat conservation is no different from any other aspect of biodiversity conservation in this regard; attempts to reduce the many threats to bats ultimately hinge on changing peoplesâ behavior (Stern 2000; Ehrlich and Kennedy 2005; Schultz 2011; St John et al. 2013; VerÃ­ssimo 2013; Clayton and Myers 2015). âPeopleâ may range from bat hunters in rural villages to government officials or politicians in administrative centers, but as stakeholders in the issues surrounding bats, they must be motivated to change their actions and decisions (Menon and Lavigne 2006). How do we determine the stakeholders involved and how do we then change peopleâs minds and behavior? The scientific training of most bat biologists leaves us illequipped both practically (St John et al. 2010, 2014) and philosophically (Moon and Blackman 2014) and often extraordinarily naÃ¯ve, when it comes to dealing with people. Surely, if we share our knowledge and âeducateâ people, they will change their ways. Hunters in Ghana and Indonesia will be so impressed by the importance of bats as pollinators of their favorite fruit, or so fearful of disease risk, that they will stop hunting them. US politicians will mandate turbine cut-in speeds that reduce bat fatalities once they appreciate the critical role that bats play in the suppression of agricultural insect pests. Home owners will learn to live with their seasonal âattic batsâ because they are keeping down the summer mosquito population. Unfortunately, providing people with environmental knowledge alone is rarely enough to promote conservation behavior, and there is an enormous body of research from the social sciences, primarily from social psychology (St John et al. 2010; Teel et al. 2015), addressing the theoretical constructs behind behavior change. These constructs have provided frameworks for empirical assessments of attitudes and behaviors toward the environment and wildlife, and new disciplines such as human dimensions of wildlife (Manfredo 2008; Decker et al. 2012) and conservation psychology (Clayton and Myers 2015) have arisen in recent years, as a growing numbers of social scientists specialize in environmental or biodiversity conservation. Indeed, the Society for Conservation Biology established a Social Science Working Group in 2003 (http://conbio.org/groups/working-groups/socialscience), and a recent report from the Group provides an excellent introduction to the conservation social sciences (Bennett and Roth 2015)."

Thus, this collection explores the implications of social innovation in cross-sector collaborations and hybrid forms, across several contexts and in multiple country settings to highlight a range of issues across social innovation models. The research presented here deliberately ranges across different socio-structural levels and units of analysis â from micro to macro â in order to offer multiple insights into the various contexts in which social innovation can operate effectively. Much of the work here also has strong policy implications: by codifying and analysing practice, its objective is to inform future policy making in social innovation across countries. This book also aims to contribute to the critical field-building project of social innovation that is already underway across a range of researchers and institutions by augmenting the existing body of knowledge on this subject with work on new trends and case examples. In the process, the hope is that the work published here will also support the building of a community of researchers looking at social innovation by adding its own, modest legitimacy to working on this subject.

The characteristics of organisations and interactions (relations) will serve as discriminating factors for providing a better understanding of certain types of social innovations. Thus, by expanding the level of analysis and by allowing for comparative analyses, the database can strengthen and build the existing links between social innovation and social transformation. In this way, it will allow for a thorough examination of a central assumption of CRISES, namely that room for innovation and experimentation widens when the macro-social regulations (market, state, collective agreements) are in flux. In such a context, micro-systems can serve as places from which to identify the processes in which new social patterns emerge. By building clusters (Schumpeter, 1932; Porter, 1990) and by institutionalising along different logics, they can form systems and eventually shape new national trajectories of growth (Hollingsworth and Boyer, 1997; Strange, 1996; Crouch and Streeck, 1996)."

The proposal concerning awareness of the limits of scientific and technical abilities was formed through interdisciplinary discussions among the experts. Some readers of the SCJ report seem to have felt uneasiness with this proposal because this proposal apparently cast a scientific doubt on the feasibility of the geological disposal of HLW. To the authorâs understanding, this proposal is a rather general statement that there is no perfect scientific evidence to support the safety of HLW disposal for more than 10,000 years. Having heard the discussions related to this proposal, the author recognized there are many different academic approaches depending on the field of science. For example, natural scientists seek truths in natural phenomena, whereas engineers try to make things and/or systems that are valuable and acceptable for human society. HLW issues are related not only to various fields of science, but also to value systems shared by society. Here again, the author was convinced that we need to reflect more deeply on the relationship between science and society."
278,373,0.192,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"industrial ecology community (Cohen-Rosenthal 2004), was consistently critical of reductionist strategies that would rely solely on engineering know-how, proper technologies and market-based incentives. For Cohen-Rosenthal, the focus should be on social processes, or the actual points of connection between material and energy flows, and specifically connections between people. Yet little attention is given in IE to the relation between interests, institutions and resources (Opoku 2004), and this dimension remains to be further conceptualized â although interest in this dimension has been growing in the past decade, as we will now turn to. IE engages with various tools, which are now considered a part industrial ecology approaches, including InputâOutput Accounting and Material Flow Analysis, as well as Life Cycle Assessments. The value of LCA has been to extend beyond the âend of pipeâ perspective, which only addresses final outputs, in terms of pollution and environmental degradation. Rather, inputs and outputs are described and can be quantified and qualified across the production-consumption chain, from extraction of natural resources, through manufacturing, distribution, usage and final disposal. In more recent years, social LCA has developed to consider the social impacts in the life cycle of products and processes (UNEP 2009; Andrews et al. 2009; Hauschild et al. 2008), with more recent work in developing a social hotspots database that includes a consideration of labour intensity and worker rights (Benoit-Norris et al. 2012) and on integrating occupational health and safety standards (Scanlon et al. 2015). One aspect of the social and solidarity economy is that the primacy of people over profit is not an âend of pipeâ gesture, but rather embedded across the economic activity in question, from its guiding principles and mission, to how salaries and employee benefits are organized, to how profit is shared. We will come back to this notion in the next section of this chapter, when we consider forms of âend of pipe sharingâ to distinguish more robust solidarity economy activities from âbusiness as usualâ. The notion of reciprocity, which is an important concept underpinning the SSE, is interesting to explore in relation to IE. If we continue with the notion of IE as being based on a metaphor, can we identify any forms of reciprocity in nature? In other terms, do we see cooperation or competition in natural systems? Ehrenfeld (2000) suggests that a balance is needed between both. Does altruism exist in nature? Perhaps something closer would be mutualism, which would suggest cooperation between members that lead to mutually beneficial or even neutral outcomes. For Ehrenfeld, ââ¦the power of the concept of industrial ecology lies in its normative context and in its potential to shape paradigmatic thinking. It is normative in the sense that (â¦) three features of the ecological metaphor â community, connectedness, and cooperation â are characteristics we should strive for in designing our worlds.â (Ehrenfeld 2000: 238). These three features, of community, connectedness and cooperation, are closely related to the social and solidarity economy and would merit being further conceptualized. We could draw on the work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809â1865) here, the father of mutualism in economic theory, who suggested that human activities could be mutualized towards the creation of a collective good. In terms of governance systems, the notion of voluntary engagement in complementary relations, which is important in the SSE literature, is not explicit in the IE literature. Forms of auto-organization are usually upheld as the preferred way of"

In the case of birds, the literature reports significant changes in the community patterns due to abandonment, especially negative effects on populations of farmland birds with narrow habitat preferences (Sirami et al. 2008). The correlation between the number of mammal species and the percentage of projected abandoned area in a grid cell is Ï = 0.14 ( p < 0.001) whereas for bird species it is negative at Ï = â 0.15 ( p < 0.001). Thus megafauna mammal species might be in a better position to take advantage of the new resources and space made available by farmland abandonment. We did not consider here the possible spatial autocorrelation of the data because we were interested only in the spatial coincidence between abandonment and megafauna. However, some of the future abandoned areas have been affected by invasive species, fire suppression practices, and missing trophic links during thousands of years of human use (ProenÃ§a et al. 2010; Wehn et al. 2011). Thus abandonment may not be sufficient to return these areas to a vegetation close to PNV in a short term without management actions (see Chap. 8). But even in these areas the abandonment will have immediate positive effects on wildlife by reducing human disturbance, increasing landscape connectivity, and releasing ecological processes from human control and thus increasing the wilderness value of the land (see Chap. 1). Aplet et al. (2000) describe the two dimensional space defined by the axes of freedom and naturalness as a framework for wilderness management. Freedom is understood as the absence of human control over ecological processes (i.e selfwilled) while naturalness is the degree to which ecosystems are close to an accepted ecological benchmark. Such a framework is readily usable for mapping the tradeoffs related to human management in areas affected by invasive and exotic species, thus increasing naturalness but decreasing freedom (Landres et al. 2000; Sydoriak et al. 2000), but also the current views on rewilding as some advocate for serious management commitments in order to achieve a certain perception of wilderness (Donlan et al. 2006). However, we consider that the ultimate aim of rewilding is not to recreate some image of pre-human ecosystems, but to facilitate new, selfregulating systems that appear naturally out of the current conditions. A realistic expectation is that in the absence of human management, the new rewilded areas will form novel ecosystems that share elements with the pre-human past but also integrate current factors. Minimum human management and this new wilderness of natural and self-sustaining ecosystems should be the goal of rewilding."

These reference groups âfamily, local community, nation â represent various sites and scales in the literature on home. To conclude, I would like to explore what a Luhmannian concept of home could be. As I have sought to stress throughout, I was often struck by the fact that hostel residents felt compelled to justify their presence in France on the basis of healthcare needs and administrative requirements, revealing the influence of medical and bureaucratic organisations on the menâs lives. This gave me pause for reflection: could inclusion in the organisations regulating access to different social systems also constitute a type of home for the men in the hostels, valued for âinstrumentalâ reasons insofar as it procures healthcare and a minimum standard of living?2 If one takes a Luhmannian view, the answer is yes. What it means to be âincludedâ and to be âat homeâ no longer necessarily implies only an emotional attachment to a territory (place) or social group (household, ethnic group, nation), as home has conventionally been conceptualised (Porteous 1976; Rapport and Overing 2007). Luhmannâs theory of social systems challenges the assumption that society is formed primarily of groups of individuals distributed across distinct, demarcated territories. This has been the dominant conception of society across history, encompassing kin groups, tribes, ethnic groups, and in the modern era, nation-states. Instead, Luhmann proposed an alternative model of society based on individualsâ acts of communication in distinct social realms differentiated by their function, such as politics, law, the economy, religion, science, and so on (Luhmann 1995). In premodern societies, social inclusion and life chances were determined by social strata and rank. But in the social systems which make up functionally differentiated society, social inclusion operates according to the codes and logics of each autonomous system. These criteria are fundamentally more inclusive than in pre-modern times: discrimination on the basis of inherited or ascribed characteristics such as ethnicity or class is no longer relevant. In principle, social systems tend to openness and inclusion: what matters is whether the ârules of accessâ specific to each system are met or not (Luhmann 1990: 35). For example, whether a job applicant has the required qualification profile, whether a patient has symptoms needing urgent medical treatment, whether a political candidate meets the constitutionally-defined conditions for holding public office. Functionally differentiated systems are âindifferentâ (Luhmann 1990: 30) to all attributes other than whatever the relevant expectations happen to be. Nonetheless, in practice, it is organisations in society (such as courts, hospitals, firms, schools, and so on) which regulate inclusion in social systems, and individuals may in fact be exposed to considerable risks of exclusion (e.g. unemployment). The role of organisations in functionally differentiated society has been most astutely analysed by Michael Bommes, who led the way in applying a systems theoretic approach to migration questions (Boswell and DâAmato 2012). Bommes argues that organisations in functionally differentiated society develop expectations about the typical person profile capable of being included as an organisational mem2"

277,8,0.191,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"In this context, the social sciences have played an important role in shaping public understanding of immigrant integration processes, and in many cases also in shaping government policies. When this started to happen and the way in which this took place, however, varies from one country to another, and from city to city. The specific role of social scientists in shaping policies also varies greatly: in some cases researchers have been quite active both in the scientific process of formulating the content of policies and in the political process of getting policies established. In other cases, social scientists have distanced themselves, or have been kept at a distance, from policymaking. Between these two positions many variations also exist. Scientists may have influenced policies, but the reverse may also be the case: policymakers may play a role in shaping the production of knowledge. Policymakers may solicit the knowledge they wish to have in many ways and with varying degrees of scientific freedom for researchers. Major differences exist between European countries in the way relations between policy and research on immigrant integration have evolved. Nowadays, however, a feature common to many European countries is that the body of scientificallybased knowledge on immigrant integration has increased substantially, while at the same time public authorities seem to have become less interested in making use of the assembled knowledge. The current relationship between migration research and policymaking seems to have led to a certain disenchantment about researchpolicy dialogues. Although the idea of âevidence-based policymakingâ has gained wide recognition discursively, strong evidence also exists that politicians and policymakers often use scientific research for symbolic rather than instrumental purposes (Boswell 2009). Clearly, in parallel with the increasing politicisation of the field, earlier optimism about the value of academic expertise in guiding rational societal steering has yielded to a growing cynicism about the validity of research and the credibility of researchers (Scholten and Verbeek 2014). At the same time, various scholars have indicated their disenchantment about the policy-driven orientation of research in this area and the lack of theoretical development in this research field (Favell 2003; Bommes and ThrÃ¤nhardt 2010). They see this as an effect of the intense contacts between researchers and policymakers that have existed in several countries. Critics have coined the term âmethodological nationalismâ to describe research fields where choice of topics, questions to be answered, conceptual and theoretical approaches, and the sources to be used largely depend on political and policy framing by national governmental actors (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002). This, in turn, has led to a call for more independent, theory-driven and (international) comparative research (Penninx et al. 2006). This book aims to develop deeper insights into how research and policymaking in the field of migrant integration have developed historically and how this interrelationship plays out in the strongly politicised climate of opinions on migration in Europe. We do this firstly by developing a conceptual frame for analysis of research-policy dialogues (in this introductory chapter). This is followed by a comparative analysis of empirical cases in the rest of the book: Part I presents comparative case studies of different forms of dialogues and their functions, while Part II systematically analyses the development of research-policy dialogues in"

Google Analytics was not reporting social referral before Oct 2011, so there is a limited time series, which we can to some extent enhance with log data. The limited data we have show that there was a slight peak in social referrals around the time of a new portal launch in October 2011 (thanks to associated publicity one presumes), but after that it settles down to around 1,000 per week; since August 2012 there has been some irregular growth and the base-rate is now nearing 1500 per week. Between OctâMarch 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 the overall year-on-year general visitor growth is 90 %. However if we look at the âsocial segmentâ the visitor growth is 34 %. Exclude blogs and visitor growth falls to 25 %. Looking at blogs alone [the visitor growth rate is 58 %. The social element is a little more significant on the exhibitions site and predictably significant for blog.europeana. In April 2013 Social Referrals only accounted for one per cent of all visits to the site, a bare 0.02 % higher than a year previous. It could be that Europeanaâs social media activity takes place solely within the context of these sites and entirely bypasses Europeana.eu. In such a context we cannot refute claims for the efficacy of âsocial mediaâ, nor can we support them. In the context of the Europeana.eu website however social referral is not at present significant and is not growing above the trend for the site as a whole. So the action has to be happening elsewhere, on the social media sites themselves."

On the basis of the overall evidence, this concluding chapter discusses the implications of our findings and identifies key issues for discussion. To recognise the often overtly or implicitly normative nature of social innovation literature and to do homage to one of the most famous âSpaghetti Westernsâ, we have ordered our argument in terms of the âGoodâ, the âBadâ and the âUglyâ. âGoodâ signifies what innovations can contribute to a societyâs ability to cope with change and, more precisely, to do it in a way that change can be thought of as progress in civility. âBadâ signifies the shortcomings of social innovationsâespecially their limited impacts in an overall averse social and policy context. âUglyâ stands for discourses that regard social innovations as something elseâusually as market-based products and technologies."

267,36,0.191,"Microfinance, Eu Structural Funds and Capacity Building For Managing Authorities : a Comparative Analysis of European Convergence Regions","financial crisis â an increasing number of people deal with poverty issues due to factors such as immigration, unemployment, inactivity and marginalisation. By âmicrocreditâ we refer here to âmicrocredit for businesses/entrepreneursâ, although the term is normally used to designate two types of financial activities: the so-called social microcredit (mainly aimed at social inclusion of excluded subjects through the provision of financial support to their current expenditure as well as social services, training courses, etc.) and microcredit for businesses (supporting start-ups and self-employment initiatives), which obviously has different goals. The traditional microcredit target groups are highly risky and cost-intensive; as a result, commercial banks are not interested in catering to some customer segments, which thus end up being non-bankable. This means that the microcredit business is quite different from traditional banking. It includes innovative and customised elements such as different collateral requirements or no collaterals at all, as well as alternative methods for creditworthiness assessment. In many cases, microcredit is granted not only for economic reasons and/or to make a profit but also to serve a broader purpose of social cohesion by trying to reintegrate disadvantaged people into their communities (Leone and Porretta, 2014). In fact, different kinds of credit guarantee schemes, usually created with EU structural fund, support microcredit initiatives in several EU countries. As is known, under the programming period 2014â2020 of the EU structural funds, the role of the European Social Fund (ESF) is further enhanced, in the attempt to promote social inclusion and prevent and fight poverty, through the mobilisation of a number of policies dedicated to economically and socially disadvantaged individuals. Among the latter, there are longterm unemployed, people affected by disabilities, migrants, ethnic minorities â as well as new sectors of the society, such as women, young couples, single-parent families â who, until a few years ago, enjoyed conditions far from what today are perceived as severe social risks. The current economic crisis has severely hit the Italian economy and prompted policymakers to implement public policies focusing on the increasing risk of social disintegration, which is leading large sectors of the population towards a deterioration of the conditions to access fundamental citizenship rights, such as employment, housing, a satisfactory social life, territorial mobility and new technology. The need to prevent further social inequalities strongly calls for improved public policies able to identify the needs of the European population, especially those segments at risk of social exclusion, and thus implement instruments and programmes to meet such needs, starting from a solid and shared idea of European social citizenship.

These two categories act together hence resulting in different levels of land degradationâwhich in turn determines the effects (on-site or off-site), on the ecosystem services and the beneï¬ts humans derive from those services. Actors could take action to control the causes, levels and effects of land degradation. For a further comprehensive discussion on the conceptual framework, refer to Chap. 2 of this volume."
269,154,0.189,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"The familiar register of exhortations to interdisciplinarity â mutuality! reciprocity! exchange! â is one that assumes that differentials of power do not exist. And yet, for many people from the humanities and social sciences â and we are thinking quite beyond our own collaborations here â experiencing oneâs role in a collaboration with life scientists as a relatively powerless one undercuts these kinds of exhortations. Go to the bar at any science and technology studies conference, and it wonât take too many drinks before social scientists start telling you about how their research is often understood as âpublic engagementâ; how they consistently have to justify their expertise to their collaborators; how they have to translate (or sometimes give up on) their conceptual language in a way that is not always reciprocated, and so on. This doesnât mean that life scientists in collaborations are especially power-hungry; or that they behave badly (no doubt most would be surprised and taken aback to learn that their collaborators would narrate their experience in such ways). But it is to say that when a group of people collaborate within institutional structures that end up placing the more highly valued epistemological frameworks, as well as financial resources, largely on one side, then asymmetries result. Even among â and perhaps especially among â the most well-meaning people, such asymmetries can produce some unlovely relations. It is important to note that such relations are rarely, if ever, explicitly endorsed by collaborating life scientists, and life scientists themselves often do not gain from them. Indeed, to the extent that interdisciplinary asymmetries of power can produce silences and absences, there is a significant risk that they reduce the space for the complex collaborative entanglements that motivate many scientific collaborators in the first place. Perhaps more importantly, and this is perhaps not always so visible to collaborators, even if natural scientists in particular collaborations may appear to hold all the power, those scientists themselves are subject to precisely the same asymmetries, when they reenter a larger prestige economy that might mark their collaborations with social scientists or humanities scholars as decidedly low-value contributions. And this is to say nothing of the way that natural scientists may experience a more subtle asymmetry, as they get pinioned by the philosopherâs or literary theoristâs rhetorical monopoly on, and their own explicit exclusion from, what it means to think âcriticallyâ.

293,283,0.189,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Introduction This state-of-the-art volume taking stock of and presenting existing research on integration processes and policies in Europe was triggered by European Union (EU)-level policymaking on integration. A 2011 European Commission policy document proposes that integration policies should involve not only immigrants and the society of settlement but also actors in immigrantsâ countries of origin (EC 2011). Compared to the Commissionâs earlier deï¬nition of integration (EC 2003), this constituted a shift from a two-way to a three-way process approach. The current volume has reformulated the EUâs policy shift into a broader question for academia and integration research: What does research have to say about (the study of) integration processes and, in particular, about the relevance of actors in origin countries for integration? What does the existing literature say about integration policies in Europe and use of the concept of integration in policy formulation and practice? Does the proposal to include actors in countries of origin as important players in integration policies ï¬nd legitimation in empirical research? With the purpose of answering these questions, we asked experts in the relevant subï¬elds to write state-of-the-art chapters. Chapter 2, by Penninx and GarcÃ©sMascareÃ±as, examined development of the concept of integration in the academic study of settlement processes of migrants and in policies. Chapter 3, by Van Mol and De Valk, analysed changes in migration patterns and characteristics of immigrants as a potential explanatory factor for changes in integration processes and policies. R.

The term âsocial economyâ was not widely recognized in the UK until the 1990s (Amin et al. 2002) and is not widely used. In recent years, a robust âsocial enterpriseâ sub-sector has emerged, consisting of entities that use market-type activities to serve social purposes, but these take a variety of legal forms. In short, there is no commonly accepted concept of a third sector in the UK, and the plethora of terms and concepts in use raises questions about whether a coherent conceptualization of the third sector is possible, even in a single country, let alone across national borders. At the very least, different definitions may be appropriate for different purposes. By contrast, in France and Belgiumâas well as throughout Southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece) and in parts of Eastern Europe, the Francophone part of Canada, and throughout Latin Americaâthe concept of âsocial economyâ has gained widespread attention.5 In contrast to conceptions prevailing elsewhere in Europeâwhich underscore organizational features like charitable purpose, volunteer involvement or a nonprofit distribution constraintâthe social economy conception focuses on social features, such as the expression of social solidarity and democratic internal governance. In its broad formulations, the concept of social economy embraces not only the voluntary, charitable, or nonprofit sectors, but also cooperatives and mutuals that produce for the market, and newly created âsocial cooperativesâ that are even more clearly socially oriented.6 Since many cooperatives and mutuals have grown into enor5"
242,29,0.189,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Migration, Gender, Social Justice, and Human Insecurity and empirical research regarding womenâs agency in migration. By integrating macro-, meso-, and micro-perspectives, gender research on migration has produced new perspectives on (1) how migration systems evolve from gendered interactions between regulation and the actions of all those involved: migrants, employers, social networks, civic organizations, and law enforcement agents; (2) how the intersecting inequalities which shape the security-seeking actions of particular groups of migrants pose new challenges to justiceseeking actions. We will see this in detail in the chapters that follow. Gender is now approached as a matrix of power relationships operating at multiple levels: 1) as a resilient structure expressed through the various social and cultural meanings of being male and female that are embedded in the ethos of the state; 2) as a set of relationships that have organized the social and cultural reproduction of society; and 3) as the formation of identities and the definition of subject positions in a given social order. A key point of contention is whether the contemporary, economics-dominated framing of migration, and the diffusion of related practices of management, contain emancipatory potentials for marginalized migrants, or whether these have become another apparatus of power that has created new categories of gendered mobile subjects whose identities remain distant from the human rights framework based on citizenship as the main criterion of belonging. This has led to the exploration of the social construction of femininities and masculinities in migration. A small body of literature has now emerged on how transnational migration also impacts on masculine identities, norms, and conventions, and how men negotiate and reconstruct their identities as they encounter different gender regimes, rationalize their experience of racial discrimination, and find new lines of inter-group differentiation (Datta/McIlwaine/Herbert/Evans/May/ Wills 2008). Several chapters in this volume engage with those themes, including the studies by Haile and Siegmann (chapter 6), Sinatti (chapter 11), and Huijsmans (chapter 20). The use of âgenderâ as a heuristic device in several disciplinary interfaces (political economy, law, sociology, and anthropology) in migration studies suggests that satisfactory treatments of the relationship between gender and human rights require insights and angles of multiple kinds. Aspirations for a genderequal world cannot avoid employing epistemic vigilance to discern where and which thinking about âgenderâ is valid and how unjustifiable biases may be cor-"

The community and domestic units (blood-related or legal and ritual family units in this case) are the social institutions that mediate the causes and consequences of migration at the material and symbolic level. From a social psychological perspective, much mainstream research linked to justice in Mexico, Latin America, and North America (e.g. research into difference, discrimination, racism, violence, personality, identity, gender, inter-group relations, cooperation, and competition) has been undertaken from an individual and group perspective, leaving behind or in second place anthropological, societal, and sociological considerations.5 This has to do with the influence and weight of the behaviourist perspective, which can be traced back to figures such as G.W.

108,9,0.189,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"This was a young researcher still strictly empirical, creating the foundation for his theories. Just recently his book Algerian Sketches was released post-mortem where he writes about Algeria, the Algerian conflict and his theories. Later on, Bourdieu found that much of the social mechanisms he had found among the Kabyle were present in all manners of other social contexts. Bourdieu was one of the foremost French thinkers of the late 1900s and had great influence on many humanist and social science disciplinesâmainly in Europe. Those who have not read his work consider his thinking to be post-modern, but strictly speaking, he is not of the deconstructive school. He saw himself as post-structuralist, which was partly an acknowledgement of structuralism, but which also showed that it was not as embedded in his thinking with the degree of rigidity normally imposed by structuralism. He has, for example, done extensive research in the fields of art, literature and even studied his peers, the professors in Paris as empirical material. Bourdieu might at times be hard to understand, but his theories are based strictly on empirical material which he then has generalised to theoretical systems. With the passage of time, he introduced new terms, for example the term field, which we will return to later on. For more than a decade, I myself have used and expanded Bourdieuâs theories and found that there is a case to state that they are valid for studies and practice regarding Military Operations as well. This text should be seen as an introduction of the theories into the military field, especially regarding the field of intelligence analysis. In military context, the theories can be used to make social patterns visible. If you have good empirical material and a good analysis, then you will be able to see how actors (collective as well as individual) relate to each other. In the end, one can be both able to predict what will happen (with a certain degree of certainty) and able to make the other part (enemy or not) behave in a certain way, without them knowing that you are manipulating them. I would like to underscore that this text is primarily focused on the theory and not the empirical aspect. It only serves as a way to exemplify the theory and show its usefulness in operational analysis. I recommend the bibliography at the end for those interested in the empirical events briefly explained in this text. It should be stressed that field theory is more of an object than a tool in the text. The text is primarily a tool for training, inspire primarily military officers how to use field analysis. The overall aim of this text is to present an alternative approach to"

The âhexagonâ represents six key factors contributing to global environmental changeâ three nature-induced or supply factors: soil, water and air (atmosphere and climate), and three human-induced or demand factors: population (growth), urban systems (habitat, pollution) and rural systems (agriculture, food). Throughout the history of the earth and of Homo sapiens these six factors have interacted. The supply factors have created the preconditions for life while human behavior and economic consumption patterns have also contributed to its challenges (increase in extreme weather events) and fatal outcomes for human beings and society. The series covers the complex interactions among these six factors and their often extreme and in a few cases fatal outcomes (hazards/disasters, internal displacement and migrations, crises and conflicts), as well as crucial social science concepts relevant for their analysis. Further issues related to three basic areas of research: approaches and schools of environment, security, and peace, especially in the environmental security realm and from a human security perspective, will be addressed. The goal of this book series is to contribute to a fourth phase of research on environmental security from a normative peace research and/or human security perspective. In this series, the editor welcomes books by natural and social scientists, as well as by multidisciplinary teams of authors. The material should address issues of global change (including climate change, desertiï¬cation, deforestation), and its impacts on humankind (natural hazards and disasters), on environmentally-induced migration, on crises and conflicts, as well as for cooperative strategies to cope with these challenges either locally or in the framework of international organizations and regimes. From a human-centered perspective, this book series offers a platform for scientiï¬c communities dealing with global environmental and climate change, disaster reduction, human, environmental and gender security, peace and conflict research, as well as for the humanitarian aid and the policy community in national governments and international organizations. The series editor welcomes brief concept outlines and original manuscripts as proposals. If they are considered of relevance, these proposals will be peer-reviewed by specialists in the ï¬eld from the natural and the social sciences. Inclusion in this series will also require a positive decision by the publisherâs international editorial conference. Prior to publication, the manuscripts will be assessed by the series editor and external peer reviewers."
99,16,0.188,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"(a) the ideas of individual inventors working as or with businessmen, (b) ideas of individuals in society that may be taken up at different places, (c) market-networked innovations, generated by (clusters of) enterprises and their R&D departments and finally (d), what he calls âthe fourth quadrantâ (2010, p. 213), non-market/networked movements inventions and actions making them practical innovations. It is then not the more or less technical nature of an innovation, nor the degree to which its final (by)effects are beneficial, but the offspring from the realms of society and social interactions that might make a difference between innovations at large and social innovations. He also tries to show that in the last centuries, there has been a swing from individual and business based to what he calls ânon-market/networkedâ based (social) innovations. It would be tempting to discuss then in which ways there is a link between more social innovation and more civil society as a fertile ground for processes that generate and give room to such innovations. The view proposed by Johnson may allow a more subtle understanding of the prevailing broad consensus on the positive definition of the âsocialâ aspect of social innovation (see BEPA 2010; Mulgan 2006). They may not always be seen unanimously as good, but possibly as more promising or attractive than previous arrangements, or in comparison to the lifestyles created by the innovative products, services or regulations of big business and big government. While this allows us to feel sympathetic towards social innovations, we must still remain critical about statements and definitions that declare them as inherently good. Interpretations of the added value and success of social innovations, which reflect what is seen as good and better for society, will often be widely contested. By definition, innovations differ from prevailing routines, forms of thinking and acting. It is possible that they may become a mainstream practice, but this is never the case at the outset. They can be linked with a diverse range of goals and come to take on different meanings over time. Just as important as the initial goals of social innovation are wider political concepts and institutional systems in which they become embedded (see e.g. Osborne and Brown 2011), reactions of the social and economic environments, and the hopes for better coping strategies and solutions that they attract. The enormous impact of social environments for the shape and directions innovations take is a well known topic from the older and more established research and debates on technological innovations (see e.g. Chesbrough 2003). Basically all innovations, technological and social innovations, are, as convincingly argued by Nowotny (1997), marked by a high degree of risk and uncertainty in the course of their development. Altogether, this shows that defining innovationâand more specifically social innovationâis an issue in an evolving area of study undergoing a great deal of change and often linked with normative assumptions. Against this background, our definition avoids objectifying what is a matter of processes involving not only proponents and activists and their initial goals but also the ways contexts react and shape the ways and directions social innovations develop. We employed the simple criterion that social innovations are those that, created mainly by networks and joint action in social realms beyond business and government routines, at any given moment, raise the hope and expectations of progress towards something âbetterâ (a more socially sustainable/democratic/effective"
36,886,0.188,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"purposes, most measures are commonly based on self-reporting (or interviews) through questionnaires with scaled responses. Good questionnaires can gather information on knowledge, values, attitudes, opinions, behaviors, facts, and other information and have been increasingly used in ecology and conservation biology to assess stakeholder opinions and perceptions of and behaviors toward species or issues of conservation concern (White et al. 2005). Although many of us have designed and given questionnaires to or interviewed stakeholders, robust design that can evaluate the values and attitudes behind behaviors and provide an unbiased assessment of the behaviors themselves requires substantial preparation. Central is a solid theoretical understanding of social psychology and psychometrics and design considerations. For example, questionnaires need to quantify and maximize validity (does the questionnaire or âinstrumentâ measure what it intended to) and reliability (does the instrument consistently or accurately measure what it is intended to measure). The procedure for sampling the target population (e.g., random, systematic, comprehensive) needs to be considered as does nonresponse bias, to name but a few factors. Measuring behavior through self-reporting or interviews can be particularly tricky if the behavior is illegal or contravenes a social norm (socially disapproved or inappropriate). Respondents may not tell the truth or may skip the question, compromising data validity (King and Bruner 2000). This is key if the prevalence of particular behaviors (such as hunting bats) is the end point of the study and is even more pertinent if the study aims to assess whether attitudes are good predictors of behavior (e.g., St John et al. 2011). Recent applications of sensitive question tools from human health research (e.g., condom use in HIV research) to conservation ârule breakingâ provide much higher reporting of illegal activities than conventional approaches (St John et al. 2013; Nuno and St John 2015). If non-sensitive characteristics (attitudes or demographics) can predict sensitive behaviors, then the identification of the target audience for intervention is greatly facilitated (St John et al. 2013). Scientists are rarely trained in appropriate social science methodologies and indeed may come at human studies from a very different philosophical perspective that can influence our understanding and interpretation of social science data and conclusions (Moon and Blackman 2014). As emphasized in the introduction, we should be collaborating directly with social scientists (Mascia et al. 2003; Sandbrook et al. 2013; St John et al. 2014), but a good introduction to methods is given in Newing (2011)."
72,54,0.188,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"how these roles can be strengthened in order to support the generation of social innovation. The chapters in this section underline the importance of collaboration in producing social innovation, even while some also highlight the roles of key individuals in the process, such as Mayor Park in Seoul. In this way, the chapters in this section echo arguments made by Howaldt et al. and McGowan and Westley, which emphasise the roles of different actors within the social innovation process. In Chapter 7, SÃ¸rensen and Torfing argue that multi-actor collaboration in networks, partnerships and inter-organisational teams can spur public innovation. They argue that the principles of New Public Management are giving way to âNew Public Governanceâ, and that the enhancement of collaborative innovation has now become a key aspiration of many public organisations around the world. However, collaborative and innovative processes are difficult to trigger and sustain without proper innovation management and a supportive cultural and institutional environment. Arguing strongly that innovation is produced through collaboration and not through the actions of âheroic individualsâ, the authors describe the roles for public innovation managers that are necessary to enhance innovation through collaboration. In Chapter 8, Han, Kim, Rim and Park provide an empirical case study from Seoul. Led by Mayor Park, a famous social innovator, Seoul Metropolitan Government has developed various communication channels, both online and offline, which have enabled new forms of consultation and engagement between the city administration and citizens. The chapter outlines three communication tools and programmes that reflect the current administrationâs approach and values, and presents a case study of a particular challenge that the city government solved through engaging with citizens. New communication tools often have a limited reach, and the methods currently being used only contribute to solving a limited range of social problems. Nevertheless, Seoul Metropolitan Governmentâs approach offers valuable lessons to other cities that are ambitiously planning to initiate and drive social innovation. In Chapter 9, Tjornbo examines whether the wisdom of crowds can be harnessed to generate social innovation. The development of modern information and communication technologies has led to a renewed interest in the phenomenon of collective intelligence, defined here as the capacity to mobilise and coordinate the knowledge, skills and creativity possessed by large groups of individuals, and combine them into a greater whole. Social innovation is deeply reliant on the capacity to combine the ideas, knowledge and resources possessed by disparate"

On factory level, dependencies are modelled with ontology languages (BÃ¼scher et al. 2014) and visualised with Virtual Reality (Pick et al. 2014). The research within the area of Integrated Technologies (ICD C) aims to combine different materials and processes to shorten value chains and to design products with new characteristics. Integrating different technologies leads to greater flexibility, more potential for individualisation and less resource consumption. Considering production systems, hybrid manufacturing processes enable the processing of high strength materials, e.g. for gas turbines (Lauwers et al. 2014) (Chap. 8âLauwers et al.). Within the cluster a multi-technology machining centre has been developed in a research partnership with the company CHIRON. The milling machine that is equipped with two workspaces integrates a 6-axis robot and two laser units, one for laser deposition welding and hardening and the other for laser texturing and deburring. Both can be picked up by the robot or by the machine spindle from a magazine (Brecher et al. 2013b). Research questions comprise the precision under thermal influences, control integration, CAM programming, safety and economic analysis (Brecher et al. 2013a, 2014). Hybrid sheet metal forming, as another example for integrated technologies, combines stretch-forming and incremental sheet forming allowing variations of the product geometry without the need for a new mould (Chap. 9âHirt et al.). Multi-technology production systems facilitate the production of multi-technology products that integrate different functionalities and materials in one component. Examples that have been developed within the cluster include microstructured plastics optics, plastic bonded electronic parts and light-weight structural components (Chap. 10âHopmann et al.) (Fig. 1.5). Efï¬cient operation of production systems in turbulent environments requires methods that can handle unpredictability and complexity. Self-optimisation"

175,1046,0.187,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Social performance criteria are often not easily deï¬ned as direct functions of hydrological attributes. Most social objectives are only indirectly related to hydrological attributes or other measures of water resource system performance. Economic, environmental, and ecological impacts resulting from water management policies directly affect people. One social performance criterion that has been considered in some water resources development projects, especially in developing regions, has been employment. Where employment is considered important, alternatives that provide more jobs may be preferred to those that use more heavy machinery in place of labor, for example. Another social performance criterion is human settlement displacement. The number of families that must move from their homes because of, for example, flood plain restoration or reservoir construction, is always of concern. These impacts can be expressed as a function of the extent of flood plain restoration or reservoir storage capacity, respectively. Often the people most affected are in the lower-income groups, and this raises legitimate issues of social justice and equity. Human resettlement impacts have both social and economic dimensions. Social objectives are often the more fundamental objectives discussed earlier in this chapter. Asking âwhyâ identiï¬es them. Why improve"
232,236,0.187,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"3 Evaluation Metrics The metrics that we will use to gauge public perception of energy and its sources must be familiar to the general public rather than technical. At the same time the signiï¬cance and relevance of such metrics will be guaranteed following a well-established framework. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in the 1987 deï¬ned sustainable development as the âdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.â [1] A typical framework, empowering this deï¬nition is the âTriple Bottom Lineâ [2]. The Triple Bottom Line (3BL) is a framework, well established in the scientiï¬c literature as well as public-oriented publications, with three key elements: social, environmental (or ecological) and economics. It provides a holistic perspective to assess the sustainability of several engineering solutions. A state-of-the-art framework to assess the sustainability of power plants and their life cycle (nuclear in particular) is provided in [3]. Regarding environmental indicators in particular, the US EPA has focused on determining and developing the best impact assessment tool for Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), Pollution Prevention (P2), and Sustainability Metrics for the US. This research led to the creation of TRACIâthe Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts. The methodology has been developed speciï¬cally for the US using input parameters consistent with US locations. Site speciï¬city is available for many of the impact categories, but in all cases a US average value exists when the location is undetermined. The average values were implemented in the ecoinvent data. Further information is available at http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/traci/traci.html. TRACI is therefore useful to compare different power plants and their life cycle. Unfortunately, these frameworks are hardly compressive for non-experts. In particular regarding the power sectors, people often have misconceptions that the tool envisaged by this research program will contribute to overcome. Some of the most relevant examples that we will address are:"
169,21,0.187,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(AM), which offers a framework to integrate the knowledge, methods, and operations of the research, policy, and local practice communities. It has been developed over four decades of experimental applications to understand and manage crises of collapsed ï¬sheries, agriculture, forestry, and rangeland grazing (Holling 1978; Walters 1986; Gunderson et al. 1995). In addition to incorporating multiple perspectives, AM increases adaptive capacity by shifting decision-making processes from linear (crisisâanalysisâ policy) to a cyclic process (Fig. 1.3). This process structures learning and iteratively integrates how we modify assessment and policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring in order to track and manage change in the world (Magnuszewski et al. 2005). The search for durable solutions to crises in ecosystems and society has repeatedly expanded the scope of inquiry outward from science to develop policies based on a broader base of experience and practice. Initial experiments (Holling 1978) acknowledged government and local practice but focused mostly on bridging disciplines within science. Subsequent experiments worked to include government (Walters 1986), local practitioners (Light and Blann 2000). However, managing aquatic ecosystems proceeds over time scales (decades) that far exceed those of individual projects or individual management campaigns. To make ecosystems sustainable, the adaptive potential raised by AM must be sustained over periods long enough to institutionalize adaptive and sustainable practices. This drive to build long-term ecosystem sustainability proposed adaptive governance as a framework that would foster AM while addressing social aspects neglected in initial AM experiments (Gunderson et al. 2016). Speciï¬cally, it should create a workspace where formal and informal institutions can collaborate to understand and manage complex issues in social-ecological systems (Schultz et al. 2015). Adaptive governance would be distinguished by its capacity to increase the importance of learning and to bridge previously separate levels: formal/informal, scales of administration (polycentricity), in ways that embrace cross-scale interactions in ecosystems and society (Chafï¬n et al. 2014; Chafï¬n and Gunderson 2015)."
241,1144,0.187,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The diversity of ecological models raises the question as to which models are best suited for analysing ecological effects of climate change. Most earlier modelling studies investigated the direct responses of single (often exploited) marine species to climate change, or to general environmental variation (Kuikka et al. 1999; Rahikainen et al. 2003). However, species responses to climate change depend on the interplay between ecological interactions and climate variation, because climate affects species both directly and via their interactions with other species. Which food web setting should be used for studying climate effects on a particular species? Climate effects on a given species may depend on interactions between species because of the feedbacks these create (Stenseth et al. 2002). Therefore, food web models that consider feedbacks between species, for example by incorporating both predation effects on prey and the energy gained by the predators (Heikinheimo 2011; MacKenzie et al. 2011), probably give more realistic results than models that do not include such feedbacks (Ãsterblom et al. 2007; Lindegren et al. 2009). Furthermore, it is not known how increasing the complexity of the food webs would affect the simulated responses to climate change. Comparative studies of ecological responses to climate change from models of different complexity, which have been subject to the same forcing scenarios (âensemble modellingâ), are needed (see Stock et al. 2011). Studies of the responses of species or food webs in the Baltic Sea to climate change rely on models dealing with populations or even species groups (Ãsterblom et al. 2007; Lindegren et al. 2009; Heikinheimo 2011; MacKenzie et al. 2011; Meier et al. 2011), although some ecological"

Whilst allowing an in-depth focus at the group level in a specific place, convergent models tend to wipe off the changing historical conditions of social and economic participation for each group in the host countries. Divergent models, on the other hand, study one immigrant group in various destination places, allowing for a focus on contextual factors shaping the opportunities and barriers for integration. In her methodological essay Green explained that âdivergent studies [, which are rare,] locate the explanation of difference at the point of arrival and not at the point of departureâ (1994: 15). The examples cited in this chapter suggest that European data contains a mixture of convergent and divergent models. For the data comparing similar groups across places (such as SCIICS and TIES), the comparative strategy seems to be that of an extensive divergent model of comparison, moving beyond the observation on one specific group across countries and extending it to a certain number of specific groups. For the data comparing different groups across different places (such as CILS4EU and EFFNATIS), we can also talk about an extension of convergent models. The trend towards divergent models of comparison appears to have become more common in European research in the last decade (Ersanilli and Koopmans 2009; Huschek et al. 2010; Fleischmann and Phalet 2012). Two different sets of factors may account for this trend: theoretical and political. On the one hand, the change toward divergent research designs, especially those focusing on the local level, was triggered by the sharp critique of methodological nationalism, âthe assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern worldâ (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002: 302). The nation-state is obviously an important actor in setting out rules and regulations with regard to the entry and settlement of migrants. It should not be ignored when studying migrants and their descendants (Guiraudon and Lahav 2000; Teitelbaum 2001). However, critiques of this viewpoint questioned the ânaturalizationâ of the geo-political frame of nation-states as encompassing societal phenomena in general. In the specific case of the study of migration, it was argued that the focus on nation-states might be counterproductive for understanding migration and integration experiences (Vertovec and Cohen 1999; Bommes 2005). Focus on migration research at the national level also entailed a critique of an undue leveling out of differences within the âimmigration societyâ by its focus on national-level outcomes rather than more refined, and complex, outcomes at a more local level. Moreover, the development of the segmented assimilation theory of Portes and Zhou (1993), which focused on the importance of contexts of reception in shaping integration outcomes among the second generation, and the rise in popularity of transnationalism approaches (Levitt and Schiller 2004; Levitt It is important to note here that in her article, Green discusses convergent models with regard to the city as the chosen place, which aligns quite well with Glick-Schiller and Cagarâs (2009) argument that the city should be the main focal point for studies of integration."

By contrast, we argue for the necessity to integrate approaches of deliberation and moralization research for a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of (moral) public debates, communicative practices and constructions of values and their related norms. We therefore propose a framework for analysis of communicative practices that links (a) deliberation theory in the tradition of Habermas and (b) concepts for empirical deliberation research âpost Habermasâ with (c) social and communicative constructivist approaches to moral communication in the tradition of Bergmann and Luckmann (in detail cf.

97,188,0.185,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Built and technical infrastructures continue to be viewed by local policy makers as the most important line of defense against hazards and disasters in cities. In much of the developed world, however, urban infrastructure is aging and proving inadequate for protecting city populations (for the US see ASCE 2013). And in much of the developing, rapidly urbanizing world, new infrastructure is being constructed at breath-taking pace, often without the benefit of ecologically based design (McHale et al. 2015; McPhearson et al. 2016b). Urban infrastructure mediates the relationships between human activities and ecosystem processes and may exacerbate or reduce human impact depending on its approach (McPhearson et al. 2016c). We suggest that a fundamental rethinking is urgently needed of what makes both grey and green built infrastructures â as well as human communities with their social, ecological, and technological couplings â resilient to environmental hazards and climate extremes. We argue that urban decision makers need to move beyond traditional engineering approaches and compliment stand-alone ecological interventions to consider how to utilize combined green-grey or hybrid approaches to advance CCA and DRR. Hybrid approaches are fundamentally ecosystem-based and take advantage of ecosystem functions together with the efficacy of more engineered systems to deliver the needed level of service. Examples such as using vegetation, porous surfaces, and temporary water storage in a combined hybrid approach to limit combined sewage overflows in New York City is a useful benchmark on how cities can transmit less water through the grey infrastructure drainage system to often overloaded wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, we suggest that viewing cities as interactive urban SETs can help to keep in mind the need for more combined approaches to dealing with climate driven hazards and improve urban sustainability. The SETs framework offers the fundamental concept that urban systems and all urban services have a combination of all three domains (social, ecological, and technical-infrastructural) as part of their production, dynamics, and efficacy."

Structure contributes to the shaping of the individual resource portfolio and can either enhance or limit oneâs exercise of agency. The two-pronged approach of âagencyâ and âstructureâ sounds fine in an abstract conceptual sphere, but how does the approach pan out in practice? Kleine suggests that the choice framework can help development priorities be more participatory, engaging the recipientsâ interest and considering local and cultural elements into programme formation and implementation. It operationalises Senâs capability approach, linking ICTs as the means which are imbedded in agency and structure which eventually lead to individual choices. The choice framework requires greater work in terms of measurability, as the author admits that it is more easily applicable to individual level than at aggregate meso- or macro-levels. Bhatnagar and Singhâs (2010) assessment of Indian e-Government initiatives examines national-level data, accompanied with fuzzy measurability and myriad complex relationships. The framework identifies key stakeholders and client value by measuring cost to the client of assessing services and their perception of the quality of service and governance. The research question investigates values that can both be monetised and those that are intangible, across multiple stakeholders (beneficiaries, implementation agencies and society), thus requiring a range of methodologies to capture the overall rating for a projectâs impact. In the chapter âAn analytical framework to incorporate ICT as an independent variableâ, Dodel presents an analytical framework based on Selwynâs (2010) âImpact Assessment Frameworkâ that includes hierarchical stages of ICT involvementâaccess, usage, appreciation and outcomesâon development. These scholars argue that ICT research would gain greater relevance to non-ICT researchers by including these variables in addition to measures of individual wellbeing. The model was tested on a sample of young Uruguayans, finding that digital skills were a significant influence on their occupational achievements. Supporting such an analysis, Chew et al. (2011) claim that quantitative analysis is more likely to provide rigorous tests of causality. In their study on ICT use in women-run microenterprises, these scholars find a statistically significant, but limited, causal relationship between access to ICTs and business growth. The authors claim that at the macro level, ICTs have had an overall positive impact in terms of economic growth; however, at the micro-level, it is difficult to find such evidence and, in this case, for micro-entrepreneurs, mostly, due to the cost issues in adopting computers. These examples underscore the challenges of validating higher-level abstractions with measurable empirical evidenceâconceptual frames that can bridge local and national-level projects."
376,373,0.184,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","equilibrium point following disturbance (Holling 1973). In contrast, ecological resilience recognizes that ecosystems may not return to their original equilibrium point, but that they may reorganize around alternative equilibrium points (Gunderson 2000). Resilience is often expressed graphically with âbasin-of-attractionâ or âball-andcupâ diagrams to further clarify this abstract concept. In this graphic representation, the ball represents the structural variables of the system in relation to the controlling variables and feedback mechanisms that are represented by the shape and number of the basins (Beisner et al. 2003; Walker et al. 2012). Engineering resilience emphasizes the depth of the basin which determines the rate of recovery following disturbance. Ecological resilience emphasizes the width of the basin to represent the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand without the ball rolling beyond the rim of the basin (threshold) into an alternative basin. Ecological resilience is most commonly applied to natural resource management where thresholds and the formation of alternative stable states are of major concern. State-and-transition models represent a conceptual advance from the traditional range model that was founded on Clementsian succession by recognizing the occurrence of nonlinear vegetation dynamics and the potential existence of alternative stable states on individual ecological sites. These models were originally introduced as a âmanagement language,â rather than an ecological theory, to organize and interpret rangeland vegetation dynamics. However, the STM framework has become a major tool for interpreting and integrating both management and ecological information. Subsequently, these models are broadly viewed as being supported by ecological resilience and are most appropriately considered equilibrium models because individual states exist with a single basin of attraction and thresholds represent boundaries between multiple equilibrium states. Ecological indicators of state variables, controlling variables, and to lesser extent feedback mechanisms that underpin resilience are used to determine if a state is trending toward or away from pending thresholds (Briske et al. 2008). This information can inform managers of the need to implement actions to modify state resilience to achieve desired outcomes. The adoption of resilience theory has had broad consequences for natural resource management by providing an alternative to command-and-control management. Command and control employs a top-down, regulatory strategy that often ignores variation and the complexity of interactions among ecological and social system components (Anderies et al. 2006). The typical response to uncertainty and surprise is to increase control which often further reduces resilience and moves the system toward pending thresholds (Holling 1973; Holling and Meffe 1996). Management strategies to minimize variability and optimize production efficiency in one portion of the system frequently increase vulnerability in another portion of the system. These top-down management strategies have also been founded on unrealistic assumptions regarding the ability of managers to anticipate and implement actions, often as technological solutions, in time to prevent natural resource degradation or ecosystem shifts to alternative states. In contrast to command and control, resilience-based management recognizes both the inevitability of change and the need for change, such that it seeks to guide change, rather than to control it to maintain a single optimal state.

347,28,0.184,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Over the last few decades, the term âgovernanceâ and the specific topic of this book â âenvironmental governanceâ â have become prevalent in the social and environmental science literature (e.g. SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). The concept of governance, first established in public administration and taken up in political science, is used to depict a shift in responsibility from state to non-state actors (e.g. private or voluntary sectors) that affects structures and processes for collective action and decision-making (Stoker 1998). It emphasises social and political steering and acting in polycentric networks on different levels â local, regional, national, European and global (e.g. Delmas and Young 2009; Rosenau 2003; Wagner 2005). However, there is a great variation in how governance is defined and used. In other words, it refers more to a perspective than a coherent theory (e.g. Pierre and Peters 2000; Rhodes 1996). Our definition in this volume includes both structures â such as policy contexts, existing power relations among key actors, regulatory frameworks and organisational forms of decision-making, reflexivity and participation â and processes. Processes comprise aspects such as the evolution of organisations and interactions between, for instance, science and policy, as well as communication and interaction among policy-makers, scientists and other stakeholders. Processes also include the development of strategies, framings, communication and learning. In many respects, EAM shares with environmental governance an interest in similar core topics, e.g. multilevel and multi-sector institutional interactions, knowledge integration and stakeholder arrangements and partnerships (SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). In addition, it offers several additional focal areas and assumptions of value to the comprehensive analysis of environmental governance aimed for in this book. To begin with, there is a fundamental ecosystem-based focus in EAM that assumes that sustainable management of human activities and pressures can only be achieved if it is based on the sensitivity and complexity of the ecosystem in focus.

299,129,0.184,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"supply equals demand. Individuals are thought to vote with their purchasing dollars so as to guide the economy toward that blessed state of equilibrium, which is considered the âholy grailâ of neoclassical economics. If preferences can be manipulated by culture or corporations, by social pressures or advertising, then an economy that satisfies those preferences would appear not to serve the people but, rather, the manipulators who choose the preferences. Such a revelation would require economists to study the relative power of persuasion and political power exercised by various elites, a far cry from economics. Moreover, it calls into question the very fundamental precept that people are free agents, and undermines the value of liberty. However, it is possible to acknowledge the reality of manipulation and the (re) formation of preferences by a variety of social forces while noting that there are limits to the extent to which people can be manipulated. The cultural theory of preference formation posits something similar: that individual preferences come about when a person determines his or her group identities, and then observes the norms associated with those groups. Certain options are socially validated by those with whom an individual identifies, which leads her to adopt preferences for those options using heuristics and schemas (Wildavsky 1987, pp. 9â10). The responsive communitarian framework, to which this author subscribes, suggests that human beings are âmultipleâ beings, capable of acting in line with their internalized social norms (superego) and their pursuit of pure pleasure (id) (Etzioni 1988, pp. 11â12). The grand challenge facing the non-economic social sciences is that of determining how and to what degree each of these multiple selves, social norms, and processes of social validation contributes to specific preferences. Thousands of studies examine various elements of the general process of preference formation. However, they have not yielded reached a consensus regarding which variables to study or about the relationship among them, that is, have not been consolidated into an overarching theory of preference formations and dynamics. Instead, a thousand flowers bloom. Various studies that stress the role of broad categories of variables relevant to preference formation and change include biological (Witt 1991) and neurological (Simion 2005) factors and processes, cognitive patterns and heuristics, social norms (Bicchieri 2010, p. 297; Binmore 2010, p. 142), demographic characteristics, structural positions, and a host of cultural factors. There are also numerous differences of scholarly opinion about how socialization occurs; for example, not all psychologists agree that children attach to and attempt to emulate their primary caregiver in a single way, and there is no consensus about the relative influence exercised by each individual in a childâs life (Maccoby 1992). Additionally, because many of these processes and social factors influence preferences subconsciouslyâthey operate âunder the radarââsocial scientists further disagree about how to model them objectively, without resorting to imprecise subjective ways of evaluating their influence. A full survey of the non-economic approaches to preference formation and the hundreds and thousands of precise variables thought to play a part is beyond the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say that the non-economic disciplines have not yet presented a consolidated theory of preference formation. Furthermore, as was previously demonstrated, the relatively unified theory provided by economics has disintegrated in recent years due to empirical challenges and failure to take into"

72,10,0.183,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"natural sciences, most of the big 20th-century theoretical breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and biology did not arise in a detached ivory tower but as responses to the practical problems of the real world, and much of the theoretical distinction between basic and applied research, which became institutionally embodied in the late 20th century, misread that history â a point eloquently made in Jon Agarâs recent book (2013). Yet to describe the study of social innovation as a craft knowledge is not to imply any less need for research rigour. There is still a need for falsifiable hypotheses â the more clear-cut, or surprising, the better. There is certainly a need for data â time series data on the growth or decay of social organisations, their contribution to GDP, their social make-up, their geography, and so on â and we should hope that over the next decade social innovation can begin to catch up with the rapid progress being made in the statistical study of other fields of innovation. Examples of this include the progress being made in measuring intangibles, the pioneering work on measuring the creative economy (Bakhshi et al., 2012) and the use of web-scraping and other tools to show economic phenomena before they have been captured by official statistics (Bakhshi and Mateos-Garcia, 2012). That sort of rigour is bound to take research away from the immediate concerns of practitioners, and so a balance needs to be struck. The Italian philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci (1979) famously commented that we should cultivate pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will; perhaps what we most need here is to combine enthusiasm of the spirit and scepticism of the intellect. Striking that balance is a challenge both for the field and for individuals. Many individuals researching social innovation are also practitioners and activists; they are advocates as well as scholars, immersed in the mission as well as the measurement and analysis. This is bound to create tensions. But again, it is not so different from other areas of social science â from late 19th-century sociology to late 20th-century rational choice economics, many of the most apparently detached intellectuals were also in truth advocates for new ways of seeing the world and new ways of acting on it. Joseph Schumpeter, for example, was the finance minister of Austria in 1919 (Backhaus, 2003)."

In many cases the omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Martinez-Alier 2001; Nagarajan and Thiyageasan 2006; Varela 2001). The unavoidability of feedbacks between largely structural and technical interventions and the socio-economic systems within which they are embedded, highlights the need for employing more systematic (or ecosystem) approaches to analyse cause and effect relationships and to explore future sustainable, efï¬cient and equitable development scenarios (Hopkins et al. 2011; Belton and Bush 2014). This raises the question, what processes are needed to include issues and concerns that are not currently promoted by active and resourceful stakeholders (Buanes et al. 2004). This is especially important in offshore areas under multi-use conditions, since this is a novel line of resource use which lacks yet experiences on which stakeholder groupâs work well together under which governance and management conditions and what type of socio-economic outcomes can be expected. Indeed, more detailed and context-speciï¬c socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture operations include many important factors which need to be understood: gender, employment and income, nutrition, food security, health, insurance, credit availability, human rights, legal security, privatization, culture/identity, global trade and inequalities, as well as policies, laws and regulations, macro-economic context, political context, customary rules and systems, stakeholders, knowledge and attitudes, ethics, power, markets, capital and ownership (Hishamunda et al. 2009). Certainly, the lack of consensus on the social dimension is striking when compared with the universally accepted general deï¬nitions that exist for the biological and economic dimensions for sustainable ecosystem management (Krause et al. 2015). This is even more so the case of offshore marine management. Based on the existing literature from coastal aquaculture (see references below) we identify these major types of socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture which are universally applicable: (a) Attitudes to and perceptions of aquaculture and its effects (b) Organization of and participation in planning for aquaculture (c) Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution (d) Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests (e) Effects on the wider economic and innovation system (f) Effects on cultural fabric and other social aspects As the list indicates, the social implications of aquaculture are multi-dimensional and affect multiple levels.

233,189,0.183,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"disconnected (Brooks and McLennan 1991; Grandcolas 1998). Current research (e.g., Elias et al. 2013) in the framework of community phylogenetics (Ricklefs and Latham 1992; Webb et al. 2002) shows that trophic webs have a phylogenetic structure. Phylogenetic niche conservatism mitigated by exploitative competition means that related species can have similar resource use (Cadotte et al. 2008; but see Mouquet et al. 2012). In this theoretical framework, a relict is then expected to exploit a unique niche, a prediction consistent with some of the adaptive explanations cited above (e.g., Parsons 2005), that relicts can be highly specialized (but inconsistent with relicts as generalists). Therefore, maximizing phylogenetic diversity for conservation can be expected to select for species whose resource use is unique (Srivastava et al. 2012; Winter et al. 2013). In cases where relicts are found in a very stable and specialized habitat harboring small communities, this original resource use might implicate a key ecosystem service (e.g., Gibert and Deharveng 2002). At the extreme, structuring ecological communities by conserving species on the basis of phylogenetic diversity should select against loss of function in communities, by retaining species with lower niche overlap even if ecological redundancy is decreased."

Two recent insights regarding collective imaginaries are of particular relevance in thinking about the Fukushima disaster and its aftermath. First, social imaginaries are consequential for a groupâs social resilience. Reviewing empirical works (including their own) on groups facing various adversities (e.g., poverty, health disparities, discrimination, marginalization), Hall and Lamont [11, 12] argue that social imaginaries are constitutive of the collective capabilities of a community or society, as they not only bind its members with narratives of its past accomplishments and a vision of what it means to belong to it, but also indicate how its members understand what they are capable of doing together. Deï¬ning social resilience as âthe capacity of groups of people bound together in organizations, classes, racial groups, communities, or nations to sustain and advance their well-being in the face of challengesâ [11], they argue that imaginaries can provide signiï¬cant resources for such a capacity. For instance, social recognition and status of a groupâi.e., where it stands in collective imaginariesâshape capabilities of its members by influencing how they can secure support from others, as well as how they perceive their own efï¬cacy [11]. Put another way, how collective imaginaries specify and support group identities and deï¬ne who qualify as valued members of the collectivity can be direct sources of resilience for group members [12]. Conversely, when these imaginaries stigmatize a group, they constrain capabilities of its members. At the same time, groups might turn to collective imaginaries for tool to cope with difï¬culties: In coping with discrimination, members of marginalized groups in the United States often rely on such cultural resources as principles of equality as a key American creed (e.g., [26]), whereas a strong group identity has been found to alleviate the impact of adverse experiences. In sum, imaginaries serve as important resourcesâor constraintsâfor social resilience, independently of and consequentially for a groupâs access to material resources. Second, imaginaries play a signiï¬cant role in the way a society addresses science and technology. Jasanoff ([17]; also see Jasanoff and Kim [18]) argues that visions of future developments in science and technology are inevitably and intricately connected to collective visions of good and attainable futures, positing a concept of âsociotechnical imaginaries.â Deï¬ned as âcollectively held, institutionally stabilized, and publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science and technologyâ [17], this concept allows us to explore and better understand the complex interplay between developments in science, technology, and society. For instance, examining the development and regulation of nuclear power in the United States and South Korea, Jasanoff and Kim [18] identify different ways in which nationhood and nuclear power have been imagined together in the two countries, as well as how such different imaginaries illuminate their different responses to nuclear disasters and the spread of"
56,69,0.183,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"In Chap. 1 I noted the importance of remittances for hostel residents and their families. Viewing migration as a strategy to insure against risks to household income, the ânew economics of labour migrationâ approach is far better able to explain the significance of remittances than the neo-classical approach with its assumption of utility-maximising individuals. A second factor is the ability to re-integrate and gain acceptance by the home community after a long absence: the structuralist literature is useful here. Improved (and cheaper) communications and transport is a further factor of note: a burgeoning literature on âtransnationalismâ has emerged in the last 20 years grounded largely in these explanatory variables. Finally, I underlined the worrying situation facing many hostel residents in terms of ill-health and poverty, and the importance of accessing healthcare and social security benefits: social systems theory provides an innovative framework for theorising such factors. For each of these four theoretical models, the relevant explanatory variables are identified below and then applied to return at retirement, before concluding with an assessment of overall strengths and weaknesses. The New Economics of Labour Migration In Chap. 1, the neo-classical economics approach to return migration was acknowledged as the principle alternative to theories prioritising family localisation and group ties. The neo-classical approach is commendable for its theoretical neatness and predictive potential regarding who migrates and under what circumstances. Yet often these predictions do not match the empirical evidence, most notably when peopleâs migration behaviour does not tally with favourable wage differentials or purchasing power considerations. A further criticism is that in the neo-classical approach, to migrate is only ever an individual decision, a perspective which isolates migrants from their social context. Neo-classical accounts also find it difficult to account for the widespread practice of remittance sending. These latter two points can be more fruitfully unpacked using the perspective known as the new economics of labour migration (NELM). In contrast to the neo-classical focus on the utility-maximising individual, the NELM approach places remittances and the âutility-maximizing familyâ (Stark âStructuralismâ is not a term which Cerase or Gmelch themselves used. Instead, I have been guided in this choice of terminology by Cassarino (2004), who uses this term to categorise their contributions in his typology of return migration theories."
117,410,0.182,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Space as a Social Product Henri Lefebvre (1901â1991) was a French philosopher and sociologist engaged with existential ideas (Elden 2004). In his prolific career, Lefebvre wrote more than 60 books and 300 articles covering a wide range of topics. In his work, Lefebvre shows an interest in the dialectic and he tends to work with three terms rather than the dualism of the two. He conceives the three as affecting each other simultaneously, without prioritizing one term over another. Instead of searching for a transcendence, a synthesis or a negation, he studies the continual movement between them. Lefebvre has written about space in The Production of Space (1974/1991). In this book, he argues that space is a social product, or a complex social construct (based on values and the social production of meanings), that affects spatial practices and perceptions. â(Social) space is a (social) product [...]; the space thus produced also serves as a tool of thought and of action [...] In addition to being a means of production it is also a means of control, and hence of domination, of power.â Although his work is complex and not about care practices, some of his insights might be helpful to better understand the meaning of space for humanizing healthcare. Lefebvre criticizes the binary notion of objective and lived space for still starting from the subjectivity of the ego. Lefebvre aims to a materialist version of phenomenology in which the epistemological perspective shifts from the subject that thinks, acts and experiences to the process of social production of thought, action and experience. According to him, space is fundamentally bound up with social reality. Space does not exist âin itself â; it is produced. Lefebvre proceeds from a relational concept of space and views space as a social product. This calls for an analysis that would include the social constellations, power relations and conflicts relevant in each situation. This would also imply the shift of the research perspective from space to processes of its production; the embrace of the multiplicity of spaces that are socially"

275,295,0.182,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"for these reasons is a desire to maintain a strong relationship with us (whether that is economic, love, friendship etc.). Trust between individuals is different to trust we have in corporations. This asymmetry is a really significant issue for AS, because humans ground their trust in beliefs about the corporation behind the AS, not the systems themselves instantiated in a single car, robot, or computer installation. Social norming is an approach to procedural ethics outside of traditional philosophical theories from anthropology and sociology [101]. Social norming is about learning how to behave in groups to get along the best. It requires we understand social expectations. Detailed theories of cooperative behaviour stem from disciplines such as sociology, biology, anthropology and group psychology. These models are not about competence and achieving optimal performance on tasks, but about creating the most cohesive, resilient teams of organisms. Theories such as game theory contribute to understanding social norming [72]. One of the many advantages of group level norms is the ability to train AS with social norming without needing top-down ethical theories to drive behaviours. However, while there are promising avenues for research into the ethical programming to improve trust, many barriers exist for the universalization of such programming. This is because there remains vast disagreement on what the right ethical principles are or even whether ethical principles exist such that they could be implemented into an AS. What does ethical talk amount to? It seems that humans judge each others actions as ethical or not ethical based a huge range of theoretical, contextual, pragmatic and social factors that ethical theories struggle to explain beyond stipulating that actual human decision makers exhibit a sort of hopeless contrariness. There is a lot of work to be done in determining what the most ethical action is in any particular context and what model underpins such actions. However, even if we can program AS to be ultimately logical, rational or ethical, humans may be uncomfortable. Would we trust machines that obey norms without empathy [28]? Consider the origins of the word robot from the 1920 play, Rossumovi UniverzaÌlniÌ Roboti (Rossumâs Universal Robots). In the play Czech writer Karel Capek endowed robots with not just thoughts, but emotions to enable them to increase their productivity [97]. Capekâs robots were forced workers more like biological androids Replicants in Bladerunner than metal machines. If we program AS with emotions and empathy to build trust, will they suffer if we treat them badly? If AS are moral agents that can suffer, then building trustworthy autonomous systems also means building an ethical and legal framework around their use and identifying their rights [81]. Japanese roboticists are already designing robots to have âkokoroâ, translated into heart, spirit or mind [1]. Kokoro stems from animist spiritual thinking that all objects, including rocks and trees, have some level of consciousness and agency including emotions, intelligence and intention. Robots and AS of the future may need complex social identities to meet ethical and social norms."
356,189,0.182,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Multi-criteria Recommender Systems In traditional recommender systems, the utility function considers only one criteria, typically a global evaluation of resources or a valuation from the user. Depending on the systems under consideration, the utility function may be a valid approach though it is rather limited, since the utility of a given element for a particular user may depend on multiple factors. Taking this into consideration, in the past few years the study of multicriteria recommender systems has increased (Lakiotaki et al. 2008, 2011; PlantiÃ© et al. 2005). Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a very mature and active research area (Figueira et al. 2005). It focuses on studying methods and management processes in systems with multiple conflicting criteria in order to identifying the best possible solution from a set of available alternatives. Starting from research and theories from that area, (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin 2010; Lakiotaki et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2011) propose approaching the problem of recommendations as one of MCDA, following the methodology that was developed by Roy (1996) for modelling these kinds of problems."
212,90,0.181,Life Cycle Management,"In addition to information on environmental and social impacts of their products or processes, a better understanding is necessary of both internal and external stakeholders, the current market conditions and the future opportunities linked with sustainability achievements. Discussion with all relevant stakeholders helps to get information on the legal and other requirements including environmental and social concerns. In addition, such discussion is also important when setting up objectives and targets. Goals to improve productsâ environmental and social performance will also have an effect on customersâ expectations and responses. Once the status overview is performed, then the next step will be to set objectives and targets. The criteria to select possible areas of product improvement are based on the responses from the questions listed in the survey. In some cases, the social and environmental problems identified by an organization may be solved by anotherâs efforts, for example, the invention of a new technology or a supplier phasing out harmful substances due to pressure from other stakeholders. Therefore, the decision on prioritizing areas of concern for LCM initiatives is based on the finding from research on the current situation and knowledge. The following aspects are usually considered in the decision process (Remmen et al. 2007): â¢ Areas of considerable environmental and social impacts along the productsâ life cycle (Relevance).

The mission of the festival is to stimulate and sustain the interest of youth in STEM. In addition to top-level support, festivals include hands-on activities and live performances by science celebrities, explorers, best-selling authors, entrepreneurs, and world-renowned experts. As another example of large-scale public effort to diffuse science in society, the newly established support program in Turkey aims to create awareness of science and technology issues and to promote scientific culture among young people through science fairs at public schools. Based on the Science Fairs Support Program [44], public schools across the country are given monetary support to hold science fairs for students in Grades 5â12 in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. In the first year of the program, 1092 schools were funded. The fairs were attended by approximately one million visitors and 30,000 projects were exhibited by 64,000 students in consultation with more than 15,000 teachers. In addition to periodic large-scale events, such as science fairs, other examples are the Science Centers that remain at the service of the public on a continuous basis. In Turkey, the SCST resolved that a science center is to be opened in every Turkish province by the year 2023, starting with the metropolitan municipalities. The Science Centers [44] will be venues for the interactive sharing of scientific knowledge with the public as well as a means of enhancing scientific culture and increasing the rate of scientific literacy in society. In line with these developments, TÃBIÌTAK launched the Science Centers Development Support Program that is initially being used to support exhibits in metropolitan municipalities in a local partnership model. Following the SCSTâs decision, contracts have been signed with four metropolitan municipalities. The Konya Science Center has recently been opened with the Prime Ministerâs participation in an opening ceremony. The other two science centers are expected to be opened in 2016. All centers are located in modern structures with stateof-the-art facilities. For example, the Konya Science Center is 25 thousand square meters including exhibition areas, training sections, conference halls, and libraries. It is constructed over an area of 100 thousand square meters. The Konya Science Center aims to be one of the three best science centers in the world. Currently, 235 exhibitions are designed internationally and 40 are implemented in the newly opened center. One of the forthcoming exhibitions is âSultans of Science,â which includes 50 exhibition units regarding contributions of scientists and inventors to astronomy, math, architecture, and medical sciences that were transferred to Europe as the scientific advances that laid the foundation for the European Renaissance."

277,333,0.18,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"11.2.2 From AuslÃ¤nderforschung to Migration Research Early research on labour migration in the 1960s was focused on labour market issues and was done mostly by economists (Wilpert 1984: 307). It started under the term Gastarbeiterforschung, but was re-named AuslÃ¤nderforschung soon afterwards (Bommes 2010: 134). According to Treibel (1988), the number of publications on the âAuslÃ¤nderproblemâ rose noticeably between 1970 and 1973. The mid-1970s and the early 1980s can be interpreted as the main research phases of the German AuslÃ¤nderforschung, not only in terms of the quantity of studies and publications, but also with regard to the development of research and funding structures (Treibel 1988: 34). A common characteristic of the various studies during the AuslÃ¤nderforschung phase was their âsocial problemâ orientation. Migration research in the 1970s was mainly designed as applied science reacting to social problems of labour migrants, such as housing issues, health, political participation, education in schools and occupational training of the second generation (Treibel 1988: 38; Angenendt 1992: 189f; Bommes 2010). Research on foreign children and youth â an area called âAuslÃ¤nderpÃ¤dagogikâ â considerably expanded in this period as well. This approach can be characterised by a focus on educational and social problems connected with the underachievement of migrant children. Today this often rather descriptive and often quite normative approach continues in the education of social workers. The research programme âGuest-worker Research â Migration and its Social Consequencesâ established and funded by the Volkswagen Foundation in 1974, marked a step forward in the development of scientific research on the topic. Addressing return migration, social integration (with an emphasis on the second generation, families and women), and"
242,18,0.18,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Migration scholarship has been traditionally influenced by a twofold methodological bias inherited from positivist sociology and its epistemological orientations. Until recently, this bias treated the nationstate and the individual as relatively fixed units of analysis and shaped a large core of theoretical explanations about contemporary patterns of internal and cross-border movements (Wimmers/Glick-Schiller 2002). The central focus of migration studies has been the monitoring of stocks and flows of migrants, later extended to their patterns of remittances and their capability of assimilation and social integration in host societies. Refugees have been handled as a separate category, through different procedures of status determination and classification, thus producing the field of refugee studies as a distinct entity. Migration research, by and large driven by policy concerns, is often structured more by ideas concerning what should be rather than what is actually happening and emerging. Assumptions that are disconnected from the social worlds of migration can obscure significant aspects of ongoing social transformations. The intensification of various migratory flows since the 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall and processes of economic liberalization worldwide has posed huge challenges for policymakers and researchers. In particular, the transformation of the state from society-led to market-led, coupled with the rise of social network theories and theories of the in-"

Who the entrepreneur knows, therefore, becomes important for his or her ability to find suitable support to develop and grow a social enterprise. Networks, in other words, are central. In a country such as India, with multiple hierarchies, vast geographies and a large number of communities and religions, who you know and where you belong has historically been important. Today, while not as important as it has been, much of the activity in the economy still relies on trust, especially in the informal sector (Harris, 2002). Networks, and social ties, therefore, are particularly important not only to access new knowledge and financial and non-financial support but also because of the social capital that can be built. This chapter1 sets out to look at two interrelated areas: the role of networks for individual (social) entrepreneurs and the impact of these individual networks on social innovation at the system level. It does so by providing case studies of three social entrepreneurs and their organisations: Amit of Rose Computer Academy, Naveen of SMV Wheels and Vijaya of Under the Mango Tree. The case studies detail the kind of stakeholders on whom the three social entrepreneurs rely within their networks, as well as how those networks have evolved over time."

More consideration needs to be given to understanding and predicting embankment breaching as this will become more likely over time if no planning is undertaken. Upgrading the embankments, as already proposed in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, is one approach, combined with other actions such as improved warning systems (Dasgupta et al. 2014). More fundamentally there is a need to develop more sustainable long-term delta-scale management techniques that utilise sediments and sedimentation in new ways. This is large-scale controlled (or engineered) sedimentation within polders as well as working with morphodynamic processes to build land elevation and sustain natural ecological functions such as fisheries spawning (Amir et al. 2013; Auerbach et al. 2015). âTidal river managementâ has only been employed locally to date, and to be successful would require both fundamental scientific investigation of morphodynamic processes and the development of innovative large-scale engineering application. In addition to the technical dimensions of these policies, the social dimensions will also need to be considered such as education and training, infrastructure development and targeted financial support to the poorest of the poor. Ignoring these social dimensions is likely to impede or stop their application. In addition to the insights obtained, the method itself is worthy of consideration. The hybrid integrated framework and method has allowed a move away from an ad hoc external expert or purely indicator-based approach. It provides an opportunity not only to explore the interactions between domains of knowledge as diverse as oceanographic modelling and perception-based assessments of well-being but also to incorporate the views of stakeholders throughout in ways which maintain the relevance and credibility of the findings, despite their complexity. The assumptions are explicit and have been debated and challenged as part of this co-production process, and changed as knowledge has grown and the detailed questions being posed have evolved with this understanding. Hence, it provides an explicit framework to analyse the problem and provide spatially explicit output. In particular, it forces the users to identify, consider and explore the limits to knowledge of the relevant system. Such reflection is critical in problems where gaps and limits in current knowledge need to be acknowledged and addressed. It should be noted"

That being said, policy integration at a European level is undermined by the variety of different national housing policies, which are characterised by specific connotations and peculiarities, starting from the different welfare systems in place in each country. Generally, the consistency of social housing, that is, housing dedicated to the weakest segments of the population, can be measured by looking at the percentage of social rented houses owned and managed by the state on the total rental housing.25 Also, there is little doubt that the new policies emerging from the economic crisis are characterised by a strong use of public resources for social housing.

99,11,0.179,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"1.1 The Promise and Challenge of Social Innovations The effort to strengthen social cohesion and lower social inequalities is among Europeâs main policy challenges. At the urban level, these great challenges become visible and tangible, which in many senses makes cities a microcosm of society. It means that local welfare systems are at the forefront of the struggle to address this challengeâand they are far from winning. While the statistics show some positive signs, the overall picture still shows sharp and sometimes rising inequalities, a loss of social cohesion and failing policies of integration and inclusion. When we focus on specific groups in society (e.g. migrants), the situation is even more dire. It is clear that new ideas and approaches to tackle these very wicked problems are needed. Contrary to what is sometimes thought, a lack of bottom-up innovation is not the issue in itself. European cities are teeming with new ideas, initiated by citizens, professionals and policymakers. There are by now many examples of innovation, paraded by think tanks and policymakers as tomorrowâs answers. This is certainly promising. Yet this altogether too rosy picture obscures some of the drawbacks,"
72,132,0.179,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"To conclude, three epistemological issues raised by the development of the CRISES Database on Social Innovations should be mentioned. These relate to the nature, validity and interpretation of data. The case studies included in the database so far are mainly based on qualitative research methods that take into account the (inter)subjective interpretation of the phenomena under study (AnadÃ³n and Guillemette, 2007). This is reflected in the dominance of interviews as a way of learning about the point of view of key actors. To deal with this issue, the proposed database is designed to allow for a transition to a quantitative analysis of data, namely by reducing and formalising the information. Yet, how can it be ensured that their intended meaning does not get lost in the process? On the other hand, the creation of a database of case studies raises the question of the triple interpretation of data: that of the interviewees who provided the information to the researchers conducting the case studies; that of the researchers who collected, organised, analysed and published the data; and the interpretation of the team of researchers who re-conceptualised and organised the information from the case studies for the creation of the database. Given these multiple interpretations, what reading can be given of the results of the comparative analyses generated by the database? Finally, faced with these multiple levels of interpretation, how can the codification of normative evaluations be prevented, in other words, those comprising value judgments rather than facts? Nonetheless, the case studies all have a common focus: social innovation. Moreover, the three to four data collection templates used in the various research programmes at CRISES through time share many common concepts and dimensions of analysis. The case studies concerned observations that were relatively limited in time (thirty years) and space (QuÃ©bec). A number of contextual (institutional, demographic, sociopolitical, etc.) variables are, therefore, common to many of them. In short, the many case studies produced by CRISES constitute a source of knowledge and information that has been underutilised to date. Aside from representing a unique opportunity for research of its kind, the project to create a relational database requires formalising a conceptual framework of social innovation to advance the theoretical analysis underlying its work. To create a quantitative approach and a relational database is a novel way to research social innovation. It is a new way of gathering data in order to develop theories about the generation, emergence and life cycle of social innovations. Should other researchers in the world opt for a similar conceptual framework and relational database model,"

Even further, a social action refers to an âactâ which considers the actions and reactions of other individuals. Thus, according to Parsons, the basic elements of a system are âactsâ. An act requires an actor, an end/outcome, a future state of affairs towards which the process of action is oriented and an action situation, which is defined by âconditionsâ of action, and actorsâ âmeansâ, and that allows alternatives or choices. The latter implies that actorsâ individual orientations are relevant. Actions are usually not isolated events but must be seen in relation to the actions of other individuals. Thus, a âsocial system is a system of processes of interaction between actors, it is the structure of the relations between the actors as involved in the interactive process which is essentially the structure of the social system. The system is a network of such relationshipsâ (Parsons 1991[1952], p. 15). One important point is that social systems develop stable patterns that are rather independent from the individual actors. Through stable patterns emerging from repeated interactions, rules or norms evolve. In more complex social systems, such norms become generalised, appear as collectively shared knowledge and form complex normative structures rather independent from individuals. Thus, social systems are emergent phenomena, which are constituted by norms, roles and institutions. From the perspective of an individual, the social systems appear as given structures. Actors will orient their actions not only towards action outcomes, as utilitarian (economic) theories suggest, but actions will also follow a normative orientation taking third-party actions and expectations into account. Parsons thus distinguishes motivational orientations that refer to needs and benefits of individuals and normative orientations. Since there are many possible action situations, actors face the problem to interpret situations, to know, which rules to apply. Therefore, actors must share knowledge and understand signs and symbols, which help to identify the nature and the meaning of situations. These shared knowledge and beliefs and the expressive"
329,192,0.179,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"For most of the twentieth century, nonprofit organizations relied on a static funding model: foundations supplied grants to charities that delivered services otherwise not available for a variety of reasons, including budgetary constraints (for example, health care for the poor) or because of the innovative but still unproven nature of the work (for example, new models of helping at-risk youth). Beginning in the early 1980s, nonprofit organizations evolved and diversified, taking on new characteristics throughout the 1990s that would change the way philanthropists and nonprofit organizations now think about and act on their work. Many of these changes result from an increased understanding and application of the tenets of social entrepreneurship. In 1981, Bill Drayton introduced the concept of a social entrepreneur when he created Ashoka, now a global leader in incubating talent and ideas in the social sector. Drayton put forward the idea that a social entrepreneur is someone who takes the passion and rigor of an entrepreneur and applies it to a social problem. This was a new idea in two important ways. First, most philanthropy up until that point focused on the organization rather than on its leadership and talent. Second, it introduced the notion that nonprofits should still follow basic business tenets, including sound management, transparent accounting, and strategic planning. R.A.

245,801,0.179,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"3 Comprehensive Evaluation Approachesâ EUROSTUDENT and PL4SD Although the social dimension has not been able to translate into an implementable policy item on the European level, the inclusion of social dimension in the Bologna Process has initiated discussions and debates on the underrepresentation of certain groups in higher education. Indeed, the social dimension could be reconceptualised, not as an implementation policy, but as an evaluative perspective on educational policy and practice. Alongside the Bologna Process Implementation Report from 2012 and its forerunner from 2009 (Eurostat and Eurostudent 2009; Eurydice et al. 2012), a major source of data on aspects of studying related to the social dimension of higher education in international comparison has been the EUROSTUDENT project (Orr et al. 2011). The full set of EUROSTUDENT data covers the topics of demographics, including social background; access routes; study programs; accommodation, funding, and living costs; time use and employment during studies; and temporary mobility during studies. The data are drawn from harmonised national student surveys in more than 25 countries. In sum, the EUROSTUDENT data set provides a strong source of data on important aspects of student life in Europe within a comparative framework (Clancy 2010, p. 93). In this, EUROSTUDENT attempts to deal with the ï¬rst problem of the social dimension mentioned above, i.e. provision of data suitable for indicators. An alternative approach is to look closer not at the students, but at the whole education system and how it works for different student groups. This approach has been taken by the project Peer Learning for the Social Dimension (PL4SD). PL4SD is a three-year project (2012â2015) funded by the European Commission through the Lifelong Learning Programme (Erasmus Multilateral projects).1 The objective of the project is to provide policy-makers and practitioners with resources to develop effective measures for improving the social dimension of the European Higher Education Area. The instruments used to fulï¬l these goals are a database of policy measures and three national country reviews, which look at the combination of measures and processes in an education system and assess their appropriateness for improving the social dimension of higher education. Three Country Reviews were carried out in 2014. The approach of PL4SD recognises the second problem of the social dimension mentioned above, i.e. understanding how various levels of an education system and various stakeholders work together to influence learning opportunities and choice."

They are indispensable in generating knowledge about the dynamic changes in human values, identities and citizenship that transform our societies. They are engaged in research, design and transfer of practical solutions for a better and sustainable functioning of democracy. Their integration into Horizon 2020 offers a unique opportunity to broaden our understanding of innovation, realigning science with ongoing changes in the ways in which society operates. Furthermore, the Vilnius declaration supports assessment of impact as one of the basic quality criteria of good science, although it is not made perfectly clear whether such assessment is to be one of the criteria for the allocation of research resources, or if it is a post festum measure to find out if research results are disseminated and implemented.44 So, looking at policy developments in the EU and comparing them to the US, we might find some cause for optimism, even a model for other regions to follow. But, as we saw above, these same developments have their critics. As the authors of this report, where do we stand? The more positive view â in favour of greater engagement between humanists and policy makers â fits well with some of our findings in Chapter 2, where over half of our interviewees identified âsocial valueâ as the most important extrinsic justification for the humanities, defined as a broad concept ranging from moral values to informing social decisionmaking and contributing to or contesting social cohesion. Another very frequently stressed value was âcultural heritageâ, implying the preservation and critical evaluation of material as well as immaterial leftovers of the past. We also saw in Chapter 3 that much humanities research genuinely engages with the social in terms of the themes selected for study. But there are at least two problems with which we should close. First, in this chapter we have also seen that some policy makers take a much narrower view of the contribution (if any) that the humanities have to make, particularly in promoting economic growth and innovation. The problem is that, as we saw in cChapter 2, our interviewees rarely identified such values and showed very little appetite for seeing them as a goal for humanities research. So, whenever the more narrow-minded policy makers have the upper hand, there will be a serious rift with the humanists. Second, even when policy makers take the broader view and stress"

If multilevel governance is normatively deï¬ned as the process through which policymaking and policy implementation is coordinated vertically between levels of government and attuned horizontally across governmental and nongovernmental actors (see Scholten et al. 2015), we can then conclude that we have only just started out, and that much more multilevel governance is needed in practice in the ï¬eld of integration. Finally, our examination of the development of integration policies and deï¬nitions of integration at the EU level enable us to place in context the shift from the original deï¬nition of integration as a two-way process to the EUâs new deï¬nition of integration as a three-way process. That shift ï¬nds its legitimation primarily in efforts to bring together the policy activities of different parties (i.e., in countries of origin and destination) in the different but related ï¬elds of integration, immigration control, and M&D. Policies in these three ï¬elds had previously developed simultaneously but separately. It is the logic of policymakingâand not an evidence-based scientiï¬c argumentâthat has guided this redeï¬nition."

With a changing climate, policy makers and advisors face challenges on how to mitigate and adapt while taking into consideration societal goals. One of the ways to deal with societal goals in the context of climate change is through nature-based solutions, including a wide range of green and blue infrastructure measures. This chapter focuses on urban gardens, particularly allotments and community gardens, as one type of green infrastructure. Allotment gardens are mostly larger estates divided into plots that are allocated under rental payments to a single person or a family for non commercial cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants and recreational purposes. They are normally ruled and managed by local authorities, associations, or private or public organizations. In contrast, community gardens are single pieces of land that are gardened and managed collectively by a group of people. Community gardens, may have a permanent or temporary character, and are often characterized by informal claiming of urban voids with the purpose of local community development (Adams et al. 2013). In this chapter, we explore how allotment and community gardens can serve as multifunctional nature-based solutions to achieve both climate-related and societal goals. Throughout the chapter, case studies illustrate how ecosystem services are provided by urban gardens in cities such as Lisbon, Leipzig, Manchester, and Poznan, all set in different socio-ecological contexts across Europe from northern to southern regions and from eastern to western regions.

166,185,0.177,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"1.1 The Couple Relationship as the Primary Resource of Social Support Implications for the couple relationship can be seen from the womanâs perspective. One way to cope with the stress related to the illness is indeed to receive support from significant others, especially from the partner (Ell et al. 1989; Manne et al. 2004; Pistrang and Barker 1995). Social support plays an important role in oneâs life at two inter-related levels (Cutrona 1996; Weiss 1974). First, at a general level, it allows the fulfillment of interpersonal needs in everyday life. In this perspective, social support is an ongoing resource that increases well-being and acts as a resiliency factor that lowers the probability that daily life events will be perceived as stressors by the individual. Second, at a more specific level, social support refers to the assistance that an individual receives during times of adversity when she has to face and cope with a critical event. In this perspective, social support is conceptualized as a moderator factor which influences the link between a critical event and an individualâs health. In case of a somatic illness like cancer, support is sought especially from the partner (Ell et al. 1989; Manne et al. 2004; Pistrang and Barker 1995). Three types of supportive social interactions have been traditionally distinguished: emotional, instrumental and informational. The first one is of primary importance in stress situations: it refers to reassurance and love needs that a person will have when facing a challenging situation. In the case of a breast cancer, this is usually the first need women report that they expect from their partner. The second one refers to pragmatic help, like money or assistance in the realization of daily tasks. Women expect this kind of help both from their partners (daily shopping, household chores) and from the larger social circle or even from institutions (having money for the medical treatment). The latter refers to advice or information which is mainly expected from medical staff. Womenâs satisfaction with the social support they receive from their partners is an important predictor of the enhancement of their mood and quality of life (Giese-Davis et al. 2000; Helgeson and Cohen 1996).

Whether or not these hopes and expectations come to fruition is harder to ascertain, as they depend both on the values and strategies of change agents and on the impact of context on these social innovations, which can often only be verified in retrospect. Thereby we have tried, first, to avoid working with a normative concept that is imposed on social processes from a purely academic perspective and second, to take account of the fact that innovations are processes with future directions and meanings that depend on many factors. Furthermore, we have avoided assuming an inherent link between social innovation and specific organisational forms such as âsocial enterprisesâ or an individual character or attitude represented by the âsocial entrepreneurâ (for an overview on this perspective, see the contributions in Nicholls 2006). The link between social innovations and organisational forms should be an empirical question, not a presupposition."
192,411,0.176,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"and eventually derailing experience, namely that social psychology (as an established paradigm) is unable to reach the level of specificity needed to comprehend everyday existence the way novels, plays and movies do. The contradiction resurges between the specificity of fiction and the generality of academic research (M2). In order to reconcile the two, established social psychology must be sublated (in the Hegelian sense of the term Aufheben) by combining the experimental method with the âspecificity principleâ, so that social psychology becomes sensitive to the complexities, nuances and idiosyncrasies of everyday life. It would also entail a reconciliation of social psychology with the genres of the imagination practiced by Stapel during the pre-academic stage of his career. In other words the specificity principles aims to achieve a negation of the negation, a convergence of the quest for general cognitive mechanism (social psychology) with a radical openness to the transient theatre of everyday existence, bringing social psychology on a higher level of complexity (M3). But unfortunately, this third moment proves unreachable (M2 â | M3) so that his project of transforming (sublating) the paradigm falters. The reconciliation of social psychological theory and everyday phenomena proves unattainable. More precisely, Stapel is unable to overcome the tension between reality as a littered, messy, disorderly environment and the mapping techniques of social psychology. He keeps looking for the causal factor x which allows us to address a problem by pushing a button, but this presupposes that the world is as makeable and modifiable as the behaviour of test animals in research facilities. While aiming to develop a level of specificity comparable to novelists or playwrights, Stapel continues to turn research subjects into lab rats in a labyrinth. But the human world proves too recalcitrant and transient to be captured in Stapelâs mousetraps. This leads to discontent and stagnation ($). The publication factory falters. This crisis precedes his misconduct. Fabrication and falsification are desperate efforts of a craving subject to remain faithful to the logic of the established paradigm, so that the infringement could be seen as a desperate act of fidelity, committed in response to the fact that the social psychological fact-fabricating factory as such is faltering. But social psychology fails to realise a cleansing of reality, so that it is ironical that the normative trinity eventually calls for a âcleansing operationâ to clean up the Stapelgate mess. Could journal articles such as Stapelâs Science paper (a fingered, fabricated story) be regarded as a piece of fiction, a Zola-like, literary experiment? This interpretation is negated by the decidedly dichotomous or even stereotypical style of thinking of Stapelâs paper (clean versus littered environments, prejudiced versus non-prejudiced subjects, etc.), while novelists and playwrights tend to depict a greyer and more ambiguous ambiance. The stereotyping inherent in social psychology itself is a mental cleaning device for cleaning up the messy chaos of reality. Stapel becomes a novelist only in his subsequent, post-traumatic effort to overcome the crisis, namely via writing Derailment as a âtherapeuticâ practice of the Self, an auto-pathography which at least partly allows him to overcome his Î´Î¹ÎµÏÏÎ¯ÏÎ¸Î·Î¼ÎµÎ½ (Aristophanes), his Spaltung (as discussed in Chaps. 2 and 8), while being sufficiently âspecificâ to acknowledge realityâs messiness.

169,737,0.176,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Floodplains are among the most productive habitats in the world and play a major role in the dynamics and the ecological integrity of riverine landscapes (Tockner et al. 2002). Due to the variety of different habitats, ï¬oodplains are key landscape elements for biogeochemical processing and hotspots for biodiversity (McClain et al. 2003; Tockner et al. 2010; Weigelhofer et al. 2015). Furthermore, ï¬oodplains provide a broad range of ecological and socioeconomic goods and services, including ï¬ood retention, groundwater recharge, and aesthetic and recreational values (Hein et al. 2006; Sanon et al. 2012; Rebelo et al. 2013). However, river regulation, ï¬ow control, and large-scale land-use changes have altered nearly all central European riverine landscapes and have reduced the ecological and economic integrity of ï¬oodplains drastically. More than 68% of the ï¬oodplains of the Danube River have already been lost, with the highest reductions, e.g., up to 90%, of the former ï¬oodplain areas in the Upper Danube region (Tockner et al. 2009; Hein et al. 2016). The consequences of these changes are an increase in catastrophic ï¬ooding of urban areas, a reduction of in-river retention of nutrients, the loss of physical habitat diversity, and a correspondingly high percentage of endangered riverine species (ICPDR 2009; Hein et al. 2016). As a result, the Danube River Basin is among the most pressured large rivers in the world (Tockner et al. 2009). Although strongly impacted by regulation measures, the free-ï¬owing section of the Danube between Vienna and Bratislava is one of the last remnants of ï¬uvial landscapes in the Upper Danube and in central Europe. It provides habitat for a diverse fauna and ï¬ora and was designated as a national park in 1996 (Reckendorfer et al. 2005). Within this stretch, the urban Lobau ï¬oodplain is located, which is a 2020 ha large ï¬oodplain area in the most western part of the national park right at the eastern border of the City of Vienna (Fig. 25.1). During the major river engineering phase for the Danube between 1870 and 1885, this former dynamic ï¬oodplain has been disconnected from the main channel by the construction of a ï¬ood protection levee. Lateral embankments along the main river channel have severely altered the geomorphic and hydrological dynamics and have impeded the natural sequence of erosion and sedimentation (Hein et al. 2006; Hohensinner et al. 2008). Nowadays, the ï¬oodplain can be separated into two subareas that differ considerably in their ecological integrity due to differences in the degree of lateral hydrological connectivity with the main channel and the intensity of human use. The upstream section of the ï¬oodplain, the âUpper Lobau,â has been completely disconnected from ï¬ood events and is integrated into the settlement area of the City of Vienna, thus severely impacted by human activities. The downstream section, called âLower Lobau,â is still included in the ï¬ood regime of the River Danube by a downstream opening and is kept as ï¬oodplain forest with water bodies of varying degrees of ecological integrity. During recent decades, the vertical erosion in the main riverbed (incision) and the ongoing aggradation in the ï¬oodplain have further decoupled the wetland area from the main river channel, both hydrologically and ecologically (Reckendorfer et al. 2013b)."

Of course, each of the three contexts merge influences from the other two. Curricula and textbooks, for instance, merge sociopolitical influences with considerations from pedagogical psychology and with inputs from academic research about the past; social and political representations of the past receive inputs from both school and academy, whereas academic scholars are obviously also influenced by beliefs and experiences from their primary and secondary socialisation. what is important in the present context is the interconnectedness of the fields and the absence of a stable hierarchy between them. If hierarchies appear, they are dynamic constellations, changing in time and space and perceived differently by different actors. Communication Styles as Social Representations for further analysis of orientations in teaching history, we draw on Social Representation Theory. By social representations, we understand coordinated patterns of thinking, communication and behaving that exist among actors in social groups relative to issues or imaginary or real objects, which become relevant in certain situations (e.g. Jovchelovitch 2007; Moscovici 2008; wagner and Hayes 2005).

Indeed, âgood governance is crucial for researchâ¦ Absence of regulation is not beneficial for researchâ¦ Regulatory oversight adds another layer to the web of quality control in researchâ (Gottweis and Triendl 2006). In other words, in this third round of comments, the ethical infrastructure was suddenly regarded as an integral part of excellence in science: âHave your ethics in place!â In dialectical terms: on a more advanced level of comprehension, science and ethics became reconciled again. Both were acknowledged as complementary dimensions of good scientific practice (academic Sittlichkeit). Hwang still functioned as a foil, but now for highlighting the (self-perceived) ethical robustness of Western research practices. From a macro-perspective, the Hwang case must be regarded as symptomatic for a broader, even global development. Frank Miedema (2012) professor of immunology and Dean of the Medical Faculty of Utrecht University, distinguishes three stages in the recent history of science. Science 1.0 (M1, dialectically speaking) was a type of research that was autonomous and curiosity driven. Increasingly however, a different type of research seems called for (Science 2.0: M2), producing knowledge that is relevant for societal stakeholders and entailing economic value (Miedema 2012, p. 24). This implies new (post-classical) quality criteria, but also growing tensions and contradictions between the inherent dynamics of academic work and the societal and economic expectations involved. But eventually, according to the author, a situation of co-creation is evolving (â M3), in which the questions and interests of science and society become more adequately aligned and knowledge production becomes coproduction: Science 3.0 (M3) (cf. Gibbons et al. 1994; Nowotny et al. 2001; Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 2001)."
169,18,0.176,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(Kagalou et al. 2012). Gari et al. (2015) conclude that two factors explain the widespread use of DPSIR, especially in the realm of policy-related science: â. . .it structures the indicators with reference to the political objectives related to the environmental problem addressed; and . . . it focuses on supposed causal relationships in a clear way that appeals to policy actors (Smeets and Weterings 1999).â However, the use of DPSIR has been complicated by discrepancies in its application, such as the placement of the same variables in different categories (Gari et al. 2015). As applied by the EEA (2003), the categories of the DPSIR framework are described as follows. Driving forces are created by the patterns of production and consumption that emerge from the intertwined social, demographic, and economic developments of society. These forces of societyâs metabolism drive the pressures that impact SES, e.g., emissions of chemical, physical, and biological substances and agents and shifts in land use and land cover. In response to these pressures, the state of an SES can shift physically (temperature), biologically (ï¬sh stocks), and/or chemically (atmospheric CO2, water column nitrogen). Impacts resulting from shifts in ecosystem state are reï¬ected in diminished functioning of the environment, e.g., lower human or ecosystem health, resource availability, and/or biodiversity. Any or all such impacts can precipitate responses to mitigate or adapt, which can emerge at the level of individuals and groups at different levels of organizations (Gari et al. 2015). Management decisions to hold steady or change course beneï¬t from precise measurements, but such choices grow out of many critical decisions that come beforehand. What should be measured, how, to answer what questions or policy dictates, and whose perspective should be included in the discussion? These are among a plethora of decisions that face river managers. With regard to measurements, who decides how to deï¬ne the space and time dimensions of the reference condition? What is the baseline in time against which one measures change (degradation or progress) in ecosystem properties? For example, radically different conclusions can be drawn from the number of salmon found in 2002 in the Northwestern US Columbia River basin depending on when one sets the baseline. The baselineâs date can inspire optimism (200% increase since 1930) or pessimism (90% decline since 1866) (Olson 2002). To shape sound research as well as policy, management must account for the false optimism inherent in such a shifting baseline syndrome (Pauly 1995), which can be reversed if management can integrate ecological restoration within the larger social context, restoring habitat connectivity, local ï¬sh populations, as well as local ï¬sheries (McClenachan et al. 2015). Constructive and effective engagement with these questions can help build a comprehensive overview and a ï¬exible approach that managers need to deal with uncertainty. However, the global decline of river socio-ecosystems reï¬ects a history of management that did not meet these challenges but defaulted to convention and tradition based on previous knowledge and historical relationships. Historically, river management regimes have evolved as complex webs of relationships that reinforce each other and create a momentum carrying them down a development path. In this way, a river system advances along a trajectory determined by complex feedbacks of interacting actors, policies, technologies, and concepts (Sendzimir et al. 2007)."
293,152,0.175,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Integration Policies The multilevel dynamics of migrant integration policies have been very different from those of immigration policies. Rather than the turn towards Europe described above, a âlocal turnâ seems primarily at play. This involves a shift away from historically rooted models of integration strongly related to nationally specific models of identity and belonging (see also Ireland 1994). Such models would imply, in our typology, strongly state-centric (centralist) modes of governance. Brubaker (1992), for instance, shows that French and German policies have their respective roots in deep historic notions of the French âStaatsvolkâ (ius soli) and German âVolksstaatâ (ius sanguinis). This idea of national models of integration has been strong not just in policy but also in academic discourse (for a critical discussion see Bertossi 2011; Bertossi et al. 2015; Joppke 2007). Yet, as argued earlier, this has led to an overemphasis on differences between national integration models, such as the British racerelations model, the German differentialist model, the French Republicanist model, and the Dutch multiculturalist model. The politicization of migrant integration that took place in many European countries in the 1990s and 2000s revealed the resiliency of such national models. In this period, there was a revival of ideas of cultural integration, especially in national political and policy discourses. Throughout Europe this led to policy initiatives that strengthened the importance of national history, culture, values, and norms in relation to immigrant integration. For example, during this period the Netherlands, France, Germany, and the UK introduced civic integration programmes including tests of basic knowledge about society. Joppke and Morawska (2003) speak in this respect of an assimilationist turn in migrant integration policies."

75,424,0.175,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","Pop Science, Self-Marketing, and Veriï¬ability On account of its proximity to citizens and its public character, crowdfunding also bears the inherent danger of unduly popularizing research, especially if any individual may donate to a project. Even though internal platforms for crowdfunding in which only researchers can donate to a project proposal may develop faster, it is conceivableâas with the peer review in traditional fundingâthat mainstream research is favored. Some also suspect that crowdfunding, but also social payments, could establish a disproportionate preference of applied research over basic research (Giles 2012, p. 253). The same could also be suspected for popular science or science that lends itself easily to media portrayal. Crowdfunding, social payments, and virtual currencies place new demands on researchersâ self-marketing (Ledford 2012), but these demands need not be a bad thing, since a clear, succinct, and understandable presentation of a project proposal can only enhance and augment the verifiability and testability of scientific concepts by eliminating the dense prose and difficult wording found in many funding applications (language that is often mandated by fundersâ requirements), thus promoting the intersubjective verifiability of scientific concepts called for by science theory and philosophy of science. A more solid grounding in the scientific community might be achieved if crowdfunding, social payments and virtual currencies were not applied in entirely open contexts, but rather only within scientific communities (if necessary under the umbrella of discipline-specific associations or learned societies). In such a scenario, however, the aspect of involvement of civic society would be lost."
99,292,0.175,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Finally, many governance concepts still imply a central role for decision-making by powerful elites. Yet, if top-down and bottom-up initiatives are to be reconciled, public policies should be less about imposing change and more about preparing it through experiments and pilots. These should be designed to learn from social competences, accumulated through the change makers that have invented and carried them through (Then and Mildenberger 2014). In the debates on the persistence of hierarchy (Lynn 2011) and new forms of governance that are sensible for this challenge, some have labelled such an approach âdemocratic experimentalismâ (Sabel 2012). Nudging change and preparing reform in this manner should be higher on the policy agenda. These critical remarks point towards the conclusions of the second part of this chapter, which discussed how social innovations change once they become part of a local welfare system and spread from one place to another. Specifically, it focused on how diffusion of social innovations in local welfare is qualitatively distinct from the diffusion of other types of innovations. Typical of social innovations is their strong link to specific contexts. Exactly because they evolve within social relationships and rely upon the collaboration of various different actors, they are relatively hard to transplant from one context to another. Furthermore, those who invented a new local social innovation are often not primarily interested in diffusion since they were originally motivated to solve a local problem. This is a fundamental difference with innovations in a business context because there the objective is to spread products as far and wide as possible. The process of winning importance also appears to be different from the marketing of innovative products and purposeful mainstreaming by policymakers and administrators. Theoretically, one would expect the bottleneck in social innovation in a complex field such as welfare to be flaws in adaptation processes, but this does not appear to be the case in practice (as compared, for instance, to the diffusion of governmental innovations). One possible explanation is that social innovations tend to have a strong bottom-up element that allows them to evolve organically, with large contributions from local people and voluntary organisations. This is part of a transformative process prior to the adoption of an innovation that changes local social relations, for instance, by giving the voluntary sector a greater role in shaping local services. The actual innovation is just the final stage of this process and not necessarily the most important part of it. The findings point towards a bias in the research on diffusion. It tends to emphasise the adoption of an innovation, failing to cover the process of transformation in social relations that occur ahead of adoption. By implication, it overstates the role of organisations involved in the direct transfer of innovations (particularly professional networks) and underestimates the role of actors involved in the wider process of local transformation, including citizens and voluntary organisations. Arguably, the cumulative effect of small initiatives is of far greater importance to society than the few examples that achieve wider and more visible impact. In any case, research on social innovation should not restrict its focus on success (in the sense of being taken up and mainstreamed). Where social innovations survive in more difficult environments, their impact on mainstream welfare is more indirectâ as one element in a cultural turn that may be quietly successful in the long run, even if many innovations fail at the first attempt."
118,663,0.175,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"20.3 Communication on Science and Technology The importance of social aspects in the development and utilization of science and technology has been increasingly recognized not only in the nuclear engineering field but also in other science and engineering fields. The cause for this realization is the increase of social conflicts related to science and technology, such as environmental problems, ethical concerns in frontier engineering (e.g. genetics), etc. [4]. In this context, two cases immediately draw our attention [4]: the study by Wynne [5] on how the general public understands and deals with scientific knowledge about environmental contamination in the vicinity of the Sellafield-Windscale site in U.K., and the circumstances of U.K.âs government response to the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) issue [6]. It is explained, for example, that the âdeficiency model,â which considers that miscommunication and misunderstanding on science and technology mainly rest on the deficiency of the citizenâs knowledge, is not plausible in many cases [5]. Then, not only the importance of the trust in information of science and technology but also the importance of the trustworthiness of an organization which deals with the information are claimed [4]. One of the effective ways to foster the trust and the trustworthiness is mutual communication between citizens and experts, not oneway communication from experts to citizens, such as teaching and enlightening. The mutual communication may include the reflection of public opinion in the development and the utilization of science and technology, public involvement in the decision making process for science and technology issues, etc."
234,164,0.175,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"PERSPECTIVES FROM SOCIO-LEGAL STUDIES AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY (CA) It was at this point that we reviewed some of the work on capabilities from the perspective of socio-legal studies, which itself draws on social philosophy and citizenship studies. This research would most certainly not be picked up in a systematic review. We have called this group of theories the âcapability approachâ (CA). Once again, this literature uses complex concepts and language, potentially limiting accessibility and opportunities for holistic multi-disciplinary thinking. Barbardâs paper addresses âcapabilitiesâ from the perspective of the development of the European Union and its associated legal institutions. It is concerned primarily with the conditions necessary for the realisation of the European Councilâs strategic goal of becoming âthe most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesionâ (2001: 464). At ï¬rst sight we may dismiss this work as somewhat peripheral to our concerns (with professional voluntarism and health systems in lowresource settings). The language used is more up-beat; less about âproblemsâ and more about knowledge for foresight and innovation. However, the immediate link with âinvesting in people and combating social exclusionâ lies at its heart. What initially interested us was the quite different approach to the concept of capabilities. Here they are not reduced to intrinsic or raw attributes of individuals but linked to concepts of agency and âproactive securityâ (2001: 467). Barbard ï¬rst critiques neoclassical economic theories which conceptualise what they call âindividual self-sufï¬ciencyâ as a function of individual endowments, âconsisting of genetically-inherited capacities for work, and the ï¬nancial and other resources made available to themâ (2001: 465).

28,189,0.175,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"a most important element in understanding the patient and his illness ... As we have seen, treatment in psychiatry is not solely concerned with the patient. It is concerned with the patient in his total environment which includes his family, his home, his work and all other areas of his existence that affect his mental wellbeing ... it is necessary to learn a great deal about the patientâs social constellation.59 This social constellation is not static. Changes are apparent during the 1960s as social workers are advised: âUnless financial hardship is patently a factor in the patientâs mental disturbance it is not usually necessary for the psychiatrist or the social workers to obtain minute details of family income and expenditureâ. In addition, it is ânot enough to record the district or municipal ward in which the patient lives as an indicator of his social statusâ due to housing shortages, housing policy and increased social mobility. Instead, âit is better to discover whether the patient is suited or unsuited to his home area and whether he and his family are happy to conform to the prevailing standards of the neighbourhoodâ. From implied previous concerns around poverty and fixed urban spaces (which are also traditional sociological concerns), the issue becomes one of adequate psychological adjustment within any given social environment: âThis account of the patient in his social milieu is a valuable background to the more detailed information on the patientâs emotional environment which the psychiatrist will gather from the patient himselfâ. Given McCullochâs interest in the subject, it is unsurprising that this co-authored textbook, Psychiatry for Social Workers, should accord a special place for social worker interviews around attempted suicide. It is noted that âwe [have already] described a schema for a standard social history, but in the case of attempted suicide there is a good deal of additional information which must be obtained before the significance of the attempt can be adequately assessedâ. Munro and McCulloch set out a scheme for the recording of data for the specific occurrence of attempted suicide, which includes the patientâs indications of their"

Complex Systems are systems that comprise many interacting parts with the ability to generate a new quality of macroscopic collective behavior the manifestations of which are the spontaneous formation of distinctive temporal, spatial, or functional structures. Models of such systems can be successfully mapped onto quite diverse âreal-lifeâ situations like the climate, the coherent emission of light from lasers, chemical reactionâdiffusion systems, biological cellular networks, the dynamics of stock markets and of the Internet, earthquake statistics and prediction, freeway trafï¬c, the human brain, or the formation of opinions in social systems, to name just some of the popular applications. Although their scope and methodologies overlap somewhat, one can distinguish the following main concepts and tools: self-organization, nonlinear dynamics, synergetics, turbulence, dynamical systems, catastrophes, instabilities, stochastic processes, chaos, graphs and networks, cellular automata, adaptive systems, genetic algorithms, and computational intelligence. The three major book publication platforms of the Springer Complexity program are the monograph series âUnderstanding Complex Systemsâ focusing on the various applications of complexity, the âSpringer Series in Synergeticsâ, which is devoted to the quantitative theoretical and methodological foundations, and the âSpringerBriefs in Complexityâ which are concise and topical working reports, case-studies, surveys, essays, and lecture notes of relevance to the ï¬eld.

We choose this framing because of experiences of confusion around the concept social-ecological system, especially as to how boundary judgements (to the system) and relational dynamics are understood. Our framing choice does not treat a social-biophysical system as a single entity or system, but as a relational dynamic between two systems mediated by human-invented institutions (rules of the game) and technologies. This framing is also an act of inclusion as it recognises the systemic, relational dynamics between people and their biophysical environments as well as distinct relational dynamics within a social and a biophysical system (Figs. 9.3 and 9.4); situational framing sets the key initial starting conditions which give rise to inclusivity, or not. Within our preferred framing, concerns like âbiodiversity conservationâ are means of influencing the unfolding dynamic between the social and the biophysical through the design and use of new institutions that serve human purposes in relation to conservation, e.g. the institutional forms of âecosystems servicesâ if they become widespread are likely to have a major impact on this unfolding dynamic (Ison 2011). Framing choices and awareness need to operate at multiple levels and in relation to situations and practices. We have outlined our framing preference for the situations that have to be governed â structurally coupled social-biophysical systems. However, how these might be governed requires another framing choice â here our preference is to see governance situations as akin to âwicked problemsâ or situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, interdependencies, and multiple perspectives where what is at issue has to be constructed by concerned stakeholders (Ison et al. 2007, 2015a). Thus, what is, or is not, inclusive is related to the locked-in historical features of a situation that can create pathway dependencies and to initial starting conditions associated with a new issue or an emergent concern or crisis. As practice in relation to situation unfolds, there are multiple opportunities for being inclusive or not. Here we outline three matters that if not understood can affect inclusivity."

187,127,0.174,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"2 Power Systems At the epicenter of the well-being and prosperity of society lie the electric power systems. Contemporary power systems are operated under heavily stressed conditions due the ever increasing electricity demand and deregulated electricity market. Maintaining the reliability and security of the power systems under such stressed conditions is challenging. The occurrence of severe faults and disturbances in the system needs to be detected timely, and necessary actions need to be taken. In order to prepare for faults or unexpected load changes, power system operators assess the stability of the power system by examining offline several scenarios. The transient analysis that is usually used in the power system control center enhances the situational awareness of the power system operators by providing a visualization of the generator rotor angles, bus voltages, and system frequency during large contingencies. Therefore, operators can plan a set of remedial measures to maintain the stability of the system. The electrical power system is typically divided in three main sections: the Generation in large power plants, the long distance Transmission network, and the Distribution grid. There are several software applications which study the power system and its multitude of components. Some of the most used physical simulators for power systems are described in this Section."

For âglobal risks,â also termed systemic risks, classical risk analysis is not so easily applicable, since the characteristics of âglobal risksâ comprise complex cause-effect linkages, which are not fully known, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in assessing the risk. For this reason, consent to risk management strategies is difficult to obtain [2, 3]. Who or what can be âat riskâ? In social-ecological risk research, risks to humans and biophysical entities (e.g., biocoenoses, ecosystems) are considered. The causes of risks mostly lie in human activities, since many natural resources and biophysical processes are influenced by societies [4]. In social-ecological risk research, it has become clear that assessment of the risk alone is not sufficient for management and policy decisions [5]. It is also important to consider the risk perception and concerns of different interest groups [6]. In the case of complex risks which are accompanied by uncertainty, it is important to define the degree of tolerability and acceptability in order to find management strategies acceptable to all interest groups [7]. Therefore, a prerequisite for risk management and related policy-making is not only scientific evidence but also an agreement of the different interest groups on how to understand, interpret, and value the evidence. Hereafter, we will outline the characteristics of global risks from a socialecological perspective and present four arguments framing microplastics as a global risk. (a) Global risks are not produced by an extreme event or a disaster but are created in modern societies as a side effect of an âeveryday modeâ of systemâs operation [8, 9] and regulation of the supply system [4]. From this understanding, we derive our first thesis, arguing that the risks of microplastics are produced as an unintended side effect of everyday operations in modern societies. (b) Global risks are complex; thus, no clear evidence of a cause-effect linkage exists or can be proven, due to âintervening variables,â âlong delay periods between cause and effect,â or âpositive and negative feedback loopsâ [10]. These and the state of ânot knowingâ [8] contribute to a high degree of uncertainty regarding effects, especially in terms of scope and time. Thus, we"

271,613,0.174,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"which operate by the same mediated, fluctuating logic. This nesting is evident in the chapters in the second part, which deal with institutions and organizations such as journalism, blogging, schools and the Church. The nested view is most effective, however, when applied to more fluid domains. The interweaving of different figurations helps us understand bottom-up social action, such as the repair cafÃ©s discussed by KannengieÃer (Chap. 5) or the hacker collectives discussed by Kubitschko (Chap. 4). Furthermore, the analysis of everyday mediated and unmediated interactions, such as the social life in cities as analyzed by Hepp et al. (Chap. 3), is much enlightened by this layered approach. Finally, this interweaving sheds light on the interconnectedness of global and local, as shown by Robel and Marszolek (Chap. 7). This nested nature of figurations can also be extended downwards, to everyday interactions or even to individual or intra-individual level: the formation of self and identity, the expression of emotions, the regulation of bodies. The theoretical agenda certainly allows for this. However, the focus seems to be more on the upwards connection, from microtowards meso- and macro-levels, rather than across micro-levels. Every now and then, the chapters offer tantalizing glimpses of an extension towards the shaping of selves and the role of emotions in these figurations. For instance, Wolf and Wudarski discuss the emergence of new, informal ways of learning, and new forms of expertise in online gaming (Chap. 6). Friemel and Bixler show how adolescents bond while communicating through media, about media (Chap. 8). Pritzlaff-Scheele and Nullmeier show that people (sadly) have more trouble reaching decisions in online settings (Chap. 12). In these cases, the figurations expand upwards, towards wider societal networks, but also downwards, towards the shaping of emotions and identities. Throughout the volume, authors show how people and media come together in figurations through practice. The practice-based approach captures peopleâs simultaneous engagement with various media and other people, highlighting not only the interweaving, but also the coconstitution3 of figurations through people and media. The focus on practice means that media and people are seen simultaneously, without one having analytical or causal precedence over the other. In some chapters, the analytical focus on practice is combined with the nesting of figurations on different levelsâespecially Hepp et al. (Chap. 3); Kubitschko (Chap. 4), Kramp and Loosen (Chap. 9); Breiter and Ruhe (Chap. 13); Friemel and Bixler (Chap. 8). In these cases, the new figurational"
380,15,0.174,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"ComplICAtIng the pICture However, this is evidently the short and simplified version of Venezuela during the ChÃ¡vez years and not of much worth if we want to understand in depth the complexities and difficulties characterizing the unfolding of the Bolivarian revolution. Neither is it of much worth if we search for a more nuanced understanding of the Bolivarian revolutionâs successes as well as difficultiesâand how these came about. It is my belief that through exploring these questions we can achieve a fuller comprehensionâalso on a more theoretical levelâof the difficulties inherent in processes aimed at fomenting deep social change and political transformations. This is a lesson that can be valuable for political struggles elsewhere and at other times. Thus, this book tells a lot more complex tale, taking as a point of departure a broad analysis of social and political change in Venezuela seen from the point of view of the barrios (shantytowns) of Caracas where the majority of ChÃ¡vezÂ´s supporters were found.1 By exploring political history and social life in the barrios, local arenas for political activism as well as the relationship between barrio communities and the Venezuelan state under ChÃ¡vez, I will argue that the popular sectors2 under ChÃ¡vezâs passed through a significant transformation. In simple terms, they moved from a state of historical marginalization to feeling part of a project of social development and nation-building. However, the processes taking place in Venezuela also brought out in stark relief the challenges in altering social relationships, political dynamics and cultural imageries in accordance with the ideology of radical social transformation that the ChÃ¡vez government, and many of its supporters, articulated. Through in-depth explorations of peopleâs hopes, aspirations and actions, this book shows how the Bolivarian process was in essence a struggle over attempts to create new moral economies, new cultural values and new forms for social and political life. Indeed, to social activists in the Venezuelan shantytowns, âthe Bolivarian revolutionâ or âSocialism for the twenty-first century,â3 as"
99,123,0.174,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Moving on to the incubator example, Coompanion Incubator serves as a greenhouse for young and unemployed people and is financed by the European Social Fund. The target group is claimed to be challenged, inspired, and educated, and motivated by the Coompanion Incubator to set up their own business, be it private or organized as a cooperative. Only young and unemployed people registered with and directed by the national employment office are eligible for support, however, and it is the officer at the national employment office who decides whether or not a young unemployed person should be offered the support. The incubator could also offer the service of acting as an employer and managing mundane administrational tasks, enabling the individual to focus on the business idea. The combination of two features could be argued to function as the innovation in this example: the greenhouse service and the focus on a particular target group, young and unemployed people. Finally, the employment and empowerment project, Yalla Trappan, is described as a labour-integrated social enterprise. The idea behind the project derives from an initiative financed by the European Social Fund that focused on womenâs entrepreneurship, integration, empowerment, education, and equality, and was later made permanent in the shape of Yalla Trappan. Today, the overall aim of the project is to provide work for women who otherwise would have had severe difficulties entering the labour market. In terms of activities, the project provides the local community with a conference centre, a coffee shop, a restaurant, a design and craftsmanship studio, and catering and cleaning services. The target group is offered employment and employment training in the various activities organized by the project in addition to Swedish tuition and education in health care. The project is organized as a cooperative enterprise. In terms of innovative features, the main contribution to the field of social innovations could most likely be linked to the focus on a particular, previously ignored, target group in combination with the project being organized as a cooperative enterprise. The three highlighted social innovations in MalmÃ¶ address social problems of political interest: stagnation, unemployment, and segregation. Common features across the three social innovations include training, entrepreneurship, empowering individuals, and collaboration among various actors and organizations. Portrayed in in this way, the three social innovations could be argued to represent new ideas and new ways of addressing social problems in the local context of MalmÃ¶ (Nordfeldt and Carrigan 2013). Using the framework developed by Evers et al. (2014), these innovations could also be seen as focusing on the strengthening of individuals by, for example, investing in capabilities rather than targeting deficits, and by bridging the gaps between professional services and peopleâs life worlds. At the same time, when approached from the perspective proposed in this chapter, it could be argued that these innovations have developed in clearings, rather than being the outcome of certain enterprising individuals or being embedded within and supported by the legal and administrative framework of the overall welfare regime of MalmÃ¶."
75,121,0.173,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","scientists as authentic and highly credible ambassadors (see above), PR can make the most essential step away from the old paradigm to the new understanding of Open Science Communication (OSC). The common ground for both above mentioned trendsâthe âdeprofessionalisationâ of science journalism and the âdeinstitutionalisationâ of science communication at largeâis the remarkable amount of laypersons finding their voices online and the self-conception of civil society organisations demanding to be involved in the science communication process. As much as this inevitably shatters the economic base of science journalism and as much as it may force the science establishment to reinvent its communication practice, we should be grateful for the degree of communication from âscientific citizensâ. Thereby the challenge lies less in permitting (or even embracing) bottomâup movements as such, but rather more in resisting the use of public dialogue as a means to an end. While valorising âcitizen scienceâ as an overdue âco-productionâ of authoritative social knowledge, Fuller warns us not to treat broadcasts of consensus conferences, citizen juries, etc. simply as better or worse amplifiers for the previously repressed forms of âlocal knowledgeâ represented by the citizens who are now allowed to share the spotlight with the scientists and policy makers. (2010, p. 292) The questionable success of most of these public engagement campaigns has increasingly been challenged recently. Grassroots initiatives like âWissenschaftsdebatteâ or âForschungswendeâ in Germany criticise openly the fact that pseudoengagement has merely served as a fig leaf excuse for the legitimisation of research agendas which are still being built topâdown. Instead it will be necessary to supplement the dragged-in rituals of âend of pipeâ dissemination with a fresh paradigm of âstart of pipeâ deliberation. Undoubtedly such initiatives cater to the transparency and true public engagement pursued by the ideal of Open Science. Thus within the âbig pictureâ we should embrace the opportunities of the OSC era, and in particular the interactive online technologies driving it."

An important constraint of these algorithms is that, at typical non-bloom concentrations, the PIC scattering represents only a few percent of the total scattering. Thus, to maximise the signal to noise ratio, satellite pixels must be aggregated in space and time, in order to define accurate mean concentrations. Currently, more verification with PIC field measurements is underway to optimise the use of PIC ocean-colour data in models (Balch et al. 2011). PIC is also produced by certain zooplanktonic organisms but these particles are too large to be detected by ocean colour (Balch et al. 1996). Different bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use ocean colour data to identify and differentiate between PFTs or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) in the surface ocean. These can be summarised into four main types: spectral-response methods which are based on differences in the shape of the light reflectance/absorption spectrum for different PFTs/PSCs (Sathyendranath et al. 2004; Alvain et al. 2005, 2008; Ciotti and Bricaud 2006; Bracher et al. 2009; Sadeghi et al. 2011; Brewin et al. 2010a; Devred et al. 2011), methods which use information on the magnitude of chlorophyll a biomass or light absorption to distinguish between PFTs or PSCs (Devred et al. 2006; Uitz et al. 2006; Hirata et al. 2008; Brewin et al. 2010b; Hirata et al. 2011; Mouw and Yoder 2010), methods that retrieve the particle size distribution from satellite-derived backscattering signal and derive PSCs (Kostadinov et al. 2010), and ecological-based approaches which use information on environmental factors, such as temperature and wind stress, to supplement the bio-optical data for investigating PFTs (Raitsos et al. 2008). All methods derive dominant phytoplankton groups, while Uitz et al. (2006), Bracher et al. (2009, improved by Sadeghi et al. 2011) and Hirata et al. (2011) also give chl a for the different PFTs. Nearly all the PFT methods mentioned use information from the multispectral ocean colour sensors SeaWiFS, MERIS or MODIS and are based on the parameterisation of a large global or regional in situ data set in order to yield PFTs from satellite chl a or normalised water leaving radiances. Unexpected changes in the relationships between these parameters resulting from a regional or temporal sampling bias leads to a bias in the"

(2013). The major characteristic of this framework is that it seeks to apply the Total Economic Value (TEV) approach in the assessment of the costs of land degradation, which implies that the ELD conceptual framework seeks to incorporate the value of not only provisional ecosystem goods and services into its analysis (e.g. crop yields and livestock products), but also of the value of indirect ecosystem services such as supporting, regulating and cultural services (e.g. carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling), option values, as well as non-use values. The elements of this conceptual framework are described in detail in Chap. 2. The ELD conceptual framework divides the causes of land degradation into proximate and underlying, which interact with each other to result in different levels of land degradation. Proximate causes include biophysical factors and unsustainable land management practices, whereas underlying causes include socio-economic and institutional factors such as land tenure security, access to markets, population density, poverty and others (Chaps. 2 and 7)."
118,619,0.173,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"scientific analyses of radiation, reactors, and regulations. Starting off the program with these lectures implicitly communicated its priority to the students; it was important to know this information first. Throughout the day, the discussions considered how this kind of scientific information was and was not communicated to the public. Many engineers felt that it was their responsibility to do some of this public communicating and also to act as information gatekeepers. One student, for example, remarked that it was irresponsible to risk panic by releasing data to the public before professionals were able to act on it.3 Students also expressed that their role was to model and measure the available data in order to bound problems, but also expressed concerns about how and what to measure. The second day included lectures on the future of reactor design and on the ethics and âsafety cultureâ of nuclear power plants, which fueled a discussion about engineeringâs reliance on utilitarian reasoning. The first presentations from social scientists began midweek, in which new ways of thinking about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident were introduced. Students were asked to reconsider the challenges of building interdisciplinary awareness across engineering and the social sciences, but also across the more specialized fields within engineering and science (e.g., between nuclear engineers and climate scientists). The social scientists provided students with examples of how to study the institutional and organizational factors that are shaping the ongoing events at Fukushima, including the arrangements between regulatory bodies, industry, government, and academia. Instead of framing the accident in terms that are familiar to engineers, such as safety culture, students were encouraged to consider how social conditions and institutions had shaped the definition of safety. A historical perspective, for example, shows us that nuclear power is judged with great severity, in part because of the public fear of radiation. For this reason, analyses that compare the risks of nuclear power with those of motor vehicles or airplane crashes are not always meaningful. Looking back on the events surrounding 3 Mile Island reminds engineers that severe accidents will happen and that it is important to communicate about them openly and critically. After a day of social science immersion, students had an opportunity to begin in depth discussions with one another. This provided an important space for students to identify issues beyond their professorsâ gaze. For engineering students, this is a necessary exercise to facilitate a pedagogical shift away from lecturestyle learning, and to allow each student to develop a perspective and voice that is different than their professorsâ. A recent study of the undergraduate experience of engineers as compared to students in computer science, science, technology, math, arts and humanities, social sciences, business, and other majors determined that engineering students spend considerably more time preparing for class and have the highest number of credit hours, many of which are spent in lecture [21]. Engineering students quickly learn how to intake and apply the information from lectures wherein the focus is on finding the most efficient way to complete problem sets rather than critically engaging each professorâs views. 3 To protect the privacy of the Summer Schoolâs participants, comments are not linked with individuals."
223,358,0.173,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Connecting aesthetic approaches to the analysis of the construction of social space therefore enriches the understanding of the relational processes of generating shared meaning and agreeing on how to behave in the current situation. Furthermore, the aesthetic dimension of experience plays a role in defining the scope for future social space because it has the âcapacity to animate actorsâ imaginations and actionsâ (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 46). In this chapter we use this integrated relational conceptualization of social and physical space to analyze data from a series of action experiments we organized in 2009 in Israel. We invited people in small mixed groups to explore together how to envisage a future social space in the same setting. We consciously intensified attention to the aesthetic dimension of the process from the outset by choosing a fine-arts studio as the setting and by providing art materials for the participants to use there, sharing the assumption that âcreative activity with portable, discrete objects allows an extension of potential spaceâ (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 50). For this chapter we have decided to apply an aesthetic approach to the data analysis by focusing only on the visual documentation in order âto avoid committing the cognitive and rational error of ignoring the bodies of the people involved in the decision process and only considering their mindsâ (Strati, 2000, p. 20). Our objective is, therefore, to explore how much one can learn about processes of constructing current and future social space, in which physical relations are integrated, by including aesthetic dimensions of the experience in the analysis. The next section of the chapter describes the context in which we conducted the action experiments. It is followed by an explanation of the methodology that was used to collect and analyze the data. We then present an analysis of the sessions, in which we identify different configurations that evolved during the interactions of the participants with one another and with the physical aspects of a studio. In the final section of the chapter, we present our conclusions about how to conceptualize and analyze social and physical space in an integrated manner and suggest next steps."
222,72,0.173,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This book builds on insights from a multidisciplinary perspective on ecosystem services and their importance to human well-being and applies these ideas in deltas in an integrated manner to inform decision-making for poverty alleviation. There is, of course, a wide variety of approaches and unresolved questions and relationships between elements of wellbeing and the underlying ecosystem processes (Norgaard 2010; Pascual et al. 2017; Suich et al. 2015). But at their core, the key scientific issues relate to how ecosystems bring multiple benefits to society, both in material terms and through other pathways. The benefits from ecosystem services include those associated with direct economic use, with protecting health and mitigation of hazards. The book explores the issues outlined in this chapter in detail for delta environments in order to give context to the broad assessment of the sustainability of a range of possible future trajectories within deltas, focusing on both the biophysical processes of their productivity and the prospects for securing ecosystem services for poverty alleviation objectives. The following chapters also, for the first time, explore in a systematic manner how social processes such as migration, access and property rights, and social relations interact with ecosystem services to result in the distribution of well-being in deltas. The book highlights the leverage points for action on these mechanisms that have been uncovered through integrated modelling and an increased understanding of delta socialecological systems. Integration across diverse knowledge domains and model simulation is a key and novel aspect of the research, and as such the findings in this book, linking biophysical changes to human wellbeing within a coupled model framework. This allows the exploration of possible futures in a participatory and policy-relevant manner that can engage with national stakeholders."

While such a Western theory could well describe the phenomenon encountered, the Chinese cultural concept of guanxi provides far greater explanatory power and deeper insights. We ï¬nd that guanxi relations describe the power hierarchies of rural barefoot doctors vis-Ã -vis their urban counterparts, who as the insider network, have greater medical knowledge, access to health resources, and comprise the formal healthcare information system (HIS). Rural doctors then utilize mobile phones in a parallel guanxi system using their existing social networks. The Chinese concept of social relations thus provides us insights into barriers faced in implementation of HIS. Further, the concept can be incorporated into program design for interventionary programs that minimize top-down centralized control in favor of more participatory designs that give voice to the margins. The implications from the cautionary tale of guanxi mimics the recommendations of Watkins and Baulch (Chap. 4) to pay attention to the sociocultural contexts of mHealth implementations. In Chap. 7, Chen examines mHealth apps, having gained popularity in China with the proliferation of smartphones, and ï¬nds that levels of app integration into lifestyles and perceptions of the role of apps vary between users. Users have differing comfort levels and knowledge of how the apps work, leading to different usage patterns. In the intrapersonal sphere, while some users appreciated how apps gave them greater control over their health, others were worried about being over-dependent on apps. In the social sphere, mHealth apps gave users a sense of belonging to a larger community with similar health pursuits, but also caused some to feel lonely as apps facilitated exercise conducted in isolation. Chen proposes that app developers take into consideration how to empower users to feel in control of their health regime, and integrate them into a larger health community through social features in the app. KrÃ¶mer (2016) argues that few mHealth projects have applied the theoretical concept of empowerment, with existing theories relating to either personal or psychological motivations. There is an opportunity to develop culturally relevant theorizing to integrate empowerment with social influences from a Chinese (Asian) perspective. In conclusion, one might very well ask whether the âhard scholarly evidenceâ, the lack of which our editors lament, has been indeed discovered. We would do well to pause before making judgments about evidence of impact, given the range of illustrations available, and the respective lenses that varied stakeholders will use to examine the evidence base. The contribution of this volume is to argue for the application of a sociocultural structural lens to issues of power within complex and variegated societies which applies beyond that of the mHealth domain. This set of empirical and conceptual contributions provides such a lens, allowing us to shift the needle just that bit forward. This collection is exemplary in bringing a range of (new) voices in mHealth in Asia to the fore. The discipline can only gain from the increased research capacities and the growing body of sophisticated analysis and evidence."
120,22,0.172,Genome Editing in Neurosciences,"Identification of Parkinsonâs Disease-Associated Risk Variants in Brain-Specific Enhancer Elements A recent analysis of Histone H3 acetylated at lysine 27 (H3K27ac)-marked regions in the post-mortem adult brain suggests a significant enrichment of Parkinsonâs disease-associated risk SNPs within distal enhancer elements (Vermunt et al. 2014). This finding supports the hypothesis that sequence-specific changes in enhancer function and deregulated transcription of linked genes mediate the risk to develop the disease. A number of specific epigenetic modifications, such as p300, monomethylation of Histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), H3K27ac and DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) have been established as surrogate marks to reliably identify candidate enhancer sequences (Visel et al. 2009, 2013; Creyghton et al. 2010; Rada-Iglesias et al. 2011; Maurano et al. 2012). Thus, to identify specific candidate risk variants in distal enhancers, we intersected Parkinsonâs disease-associated risk SNPs (Nalls et al. 2014) with publicly available epigenetic data (Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium 2015). This analysis allowed us to compile a list of risk variants ranked by the overlap of active enhancer elements. Interestingly, many of the top-ranked risk variants were located to the SNCA locus. Because changes in TF binding are thought to be the major mediator of SNP-specific changes in gene expression (Kasowski et al. 2013; Kilpinen et al. 2013; McVicker et al. 2013) we incorporated this idea to further prioritize the risk variants in enhancers by analyzing predicted TF binding for known TF binding specificities comparing both alternative genotypes for each Parkinsonâs disease-associated SNP. This analysis highlighted the Parkinsonâs disease-associated SNP rs356168 in an enhancer in intron-4 of SNCA as the risk variant with the highest number of genotype-dependent differential TF binding in the SNCA locus. The functional relevance of this enhancer was further supported by chromosome conformation capture data, which indicate a physical interaction (looping) between the enhancer and the promoter region of SNCA that is thought to be necessary for the cis-acting effects on gene expression (Vermunt et al. 2014). It is well established that SNCA plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonâs disease. Point mutations in SNCA were the first genetic variants linked to familial forms of Parkinsonâs disease, and the SNCA protein is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis, which are considered the pathological hallmark of familial and sporadic Parkinsonâs disease (Gasser et al. 2011; Singleton et al. 2013). In addition, the SNCA locus represents one of the strongest Parkinsonâs disease-associated GWAS hits (Nalls et al. 2014). Notably, multiplication of the entire SNCA locus was identified as causal for a rare autosomal-dominant form of Parkinsonâs disease, indicating that a moderate increase of wild-type SNCA expression (1.5 times in the case of genomic duplications) is sufficient to cause an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinsonâs disease (Singleton et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2004; Devine et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2012). This observation is highly suggestive of a molecular mechanism by which risk variants in the SNCA locus modify the risk to develop Parkinsonâs disease by slightly modulating the expression"

More and better participation, and a substantial improvement in training, are a priority for all governments. This aspect was particularly stressed at Rio+20. Environmental governance of the land, patrimonial accounts, environmental assessment of investment projects, evaluation of environmental impacts, strategic environmental assessments and so forth are emerging as important alternatives. According to ECLAC (2010:140), âTerritorial heterogeneity in Latin America calls for selective and targeted strategies. Local development, understood as a bottom-up process, mobilizes endogenous potential to build territories that are better able to create and drive their own capacities.â The objectives of the National Environmental Governance Project in each country must reverse the process of poverty generation and, in turn, give more momentum to tasks already under way to directly improve the situation. Habitat improvement and policies to combat environmental degradation are systematically integrated with the possibility for a better life. In addition, the use of unusual environmental policies in Latin American countries â such as tax policies, credit, tariff or integration â all signify that there is a long way to go. While these ideas are technologically plausible, and are also key for the sustainability of the planet, it is worth reiterating critical doubts that arise from both historical experience and theory. They question the ability of the current model of accumulation and the political regime of domination to advance socioeconomic and environmental sustainable development, without signiï¬cant changes. The historical scenario seems to prolong an insurmountable contradiction between the interests to produce, distribute and consume, and the need to ensure social and environmental human life. Therefore, a greater organization and activity of environmental social movements emerges as a possible alternative. An organizational form for sustainable development within environmental governance involves a holistic view, a direct relationship between research and action. It is a combination of the short, medium and long term, and of a generally high level of participation among civil society and social movements. It proposes implementing the necessary changes and taking actions that can lead to more successful forms of environmental governance and a better quality of life. Economic understanding must be open to all necessary actors, which requires reformulating the conditions for recovery and reproduction of capital with ecological, economic, social, technological and political implications. Only then do the desired reduction of poverty and reconciliation with nature truly begin."
341,36,0.172,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter the authors have presented a narrative that supports their normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance. Jennifer McKay presents a portfolio-based approach to planning and management and argues that rapid urbanisation, growing urban populations, environmental issues and climate change all present significant challenges for water resource management, the delivery of essential water and sanitation services and environmental protection. As a result, traditional approaches that have relied heavily on large-scale infrastructure development are making way for new approaches such as the portfolio-based approach to planning and management. In an urban context this includes integration of all components of the urban water cycle, and most state governments in Australia have embarked on implementing this integrated approach by having a mix of water supply sources including demand management and conservation measures. However, effective implementation of this approach depends on policies and regulations and encounters various impediments. Accordingly, this chapter focuses on the City of Adelaide in South Australia and explores the legal and policy challenges for implementing an integrated urban water management plan in Metropolitan Adelaide. Drawing on the results of governance studies carried out in Australia that included a literature review and stakeholder and community surveys, this chapter attempts to better understand the barriers to transitioning Adelaide to a water-sensitive city. With regard to implementing an integrated urban water management strategy in Australia, there is no âone size fits allâ structural arrangement. Although there is growing support for implementing a portfolio of water supply sources, it is also true that there are impediments to implementing this approach. The authors caution that achieving (cultural) transformations to encourage institutional change for implementation of an integrated urban water management approach may take several years, and therefore planners and policy-makers must have a long-term framework for addressing these issues. Looking ahead, there is scope for further research to explore the intergovernmental issues and provide models to enable this transition and hence be a model for the world in portfolio approaches. Marguerite de Chaisemartin provides an overview and thus contributes to a better understanding of the worldâs groundwater resource, its distinctiveness and its governance â describing the principal elements of and key instruments employed in groundwater governance. To this end, the authors introduce several case studies from across the globe and offer some corresponding lessons learnt. In particular, this chapter presents an analysis of the role of monitoring and assessment in groundwater governance, showcasing the example of the Netherlands. A global diagnostic of the current state of groundwater governance is provided, based on information from a set of commissioned thematic papers and the outcomes of five subsequent regional consultations carried out within the framework of a GEF-supported project on Global Groundwater Governance. It includes insight into some of the findings of"
75,534,0.172,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","This survey presents quite surprising results for the advocates of Science 2.0. Firstly, we see that the overstated need for free access to scientific publications is not the driving force at all (none of the 50 respondents was using social tools to exchange PDFs of articles behind subscriptions). Secondly, the ââfacebook-typeââ activity of maintaining contacts with ââfriendsââ is negligible (just 2 % of respondents use Science 2.0 tools to maintain contacts with colleagues). As expected, few people use social media to sell/buy/advertise something scientific (5 % for each of these categories). Now we come to the largest shares. 10 % of scientists openly say in this anonymous survey that they are simply addicted to the Internet (in the negative sense). 12 % use scientific tools online to polish their arguments (probably before publication). 19 % enjoy Science 2.0 tools just for fun. Finally, 40 % of scientists combine fun and usefulness for work. (Compare with just 5 % of scientists who answered that they are using Science 2.0 tools primarily to get something useful to work).

A key feature of the Diderichsen model is that it incorporates both social causation and social selection mechanisms within a common framework, across the life course. Importantly, the model also explicitly links the broader social environment to the causal pathway at the individual level and makes it clear that the social determinants of health are policy sensitive (Taylor-Robinson 2013). Using the Diderichsen model, the studies outlined here explored how the clinical consequences of CF vary in the UK on the basis of SES across the life course, and"
232,352,0.172,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"Notably, not only the general public, but also many activists against nuclear power and weapons did not necessarily consider the two applications tightly connected. Even a great number of hibakusha and anti-nuclear weapons activists were uncritical of nuclear energy production.6 In a July 2011 interview, Terumi Tanaka, Secretary General of Nihon Hidankyo (Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations), said: âI have been thinking since the nuclear accident, perhaps we hibakusha may not have thought very much about nuclear power. These days I think that we need to revisit and more thoroughly study the background of the technology, the system of management, how the industry and government addressed it, etc., and continue to debate about what we can say and do as hibakushaâ (my translation).7 In sum, in the pre-Fukushima dominant imaginaries, future Japan is ecological, efï¬cient, economically prosperous, and equipped with clean energy and strong science and technology, and these objectives are facilitated by nuclear technology. In this vision, technological prowess is an important part of the countryâs national identity (see Hecht [13] for the French case), and major social and economic problems are solved by advances in science and technology, which are supported by both the government and market forces. Also implied in these imaginaries is the so-called âdeï¬cit model,â in which the publicâs skepticism toward and/or rejection of a speciï¬c scientiï¬c or technological development is attributed to its ignorance and incomprehension. In this model, knowledge is monopolized by experts, and solutions to the public objection consist of educating them with more and better information about science and engineering and raising their âliteracy.â Scholars in the ï¬eld of science and technology studies (STS) have presented various critiques to this model, showing how sophisticated and productive âlayâ knowledge can be [9, 40, 41], how âlocalâ and parochialâas opposed to âuniversalââexpert knowledge can be [41], and how increased scientiï¬c âliteracyâ does not always lead to acceptance and appreciation of science and technology [4]. These insights have problematized how decision-making about science and technologyâenormously consequential to the whole societyâis left to a small group of experts and the political and corporate elite, and challenged us to explore more democratic approaches to science and technology. For instance, critics of the deï¬cit model have called for public engagement in various aspects of science and engineering: not only ï¬nal assessment of a given option for policymaking objectives (e.g., public hearings, consensus conferences, deliberative polls), but also"
284,61,0.171,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"A Latin American ecosocialism? In the 1980s, new ideas about socioecological politics in Latin America emerged. Authors such as Victor Toledo, Enrique Leff, JosÃ© Augusto PÃ¡dua and Ivan Restrepo formulated more radical ideas about the political context of environmental governance. Augusto Angel Mayaâs explicit message (1996, 2002) was to avoid interpreting environmental problems as exclusively ecological or technological. He understood the environment as an object of study in all the scientiï¬c disciplines, from the natural sciences and technologies to sciences that study human behaviour. Beginning in the 1980s, activist groups such as the Political Ecology Institute (Instituto de EcologÃ­a PolÃ­tica) in Chile, Censat in Colombia, Ecological Action (AcciÃ³n Ecologica) in Ecuador (composed of young female biologists), REDES (Amigos de la Tierra Uruguay/Friends of the Earth) in Uruguay, FASE (FederaÃ§Ã£o de ÃrgÃ£os para AssistÃªncia Social e Educacional/ Federation of Organizations for Social and Educational Assistance) in Brazil with Julianna Malerba, and others have emerged. There is a strong Latin American environmental thinking that enumerates, and denounces the multitude of environmental conï¬icts that the growth of the social metabolism brings with it. Some 20 years later, these views have not only been expressed in writings and manifestos of social actors and alternative thinkers of post-developmentalism, of agroecology and of popular environmentalism, but also in some national constitutions, in the discourses of government ofï¬cials and even by some ministers. After the defeat in 2005 of the US plans to promote the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), new leftwing, progressive governments emerged with the electoral victories of Evo Morales in Bolivia (2005) and Rafael Correa in Ecuador (2006). In the following years it even seemed that an international âofï¬cialâ environmental leadership could arise from South America. The Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008, for example, has been a very important symbol of environmental thinking in Latin America, with the presence of Alberto Acosta â ex-president of the Constituent Assembly â in a multitude of forums. Another example was the radical speech of Ecuador representative FÃ¡nder FalconÃ­, at the failed climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009, when he made reference to the ecological debt or climate debt of the North with the South. He compared the poor countries with âpassive smokersâ and he defended the Yasuni Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) initiative to âleave the oil below groundâ in front of more than 150 presidents of state and leaders of government.8"
223,356,0.171,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Theoretical Framework Some work has been done in this direction (Baldry, 1999; Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007; Ford & Harding, 2004; Friedman, 2011; Kornberger & Clegg, 2004; Meusburger, 2009; Taylor & Spicer, 2007; Woodward & Ellison, 2010). A review of the growing literature on space in organization studies found the field fragmented but identified three principal streams, each with interesting contributions and shortcomings (Taylor & Spicer, 2007). In one stream scholars conceive of space in terms of distance and proximity between points and have convincingly demonstrated how space makes a difference for important issues at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels. However, they are âunable to account for the ways in which actors attribute meaning and significance to a space â¦ [and] not able to explain the role which perceptions or experiences of distances and proximity playâ (p. 329). In another stream researchers compensate for this weakness by focusing on the materialization of powerâbut it is questionable âwhether all spaces are necessarily manifestations of powerâ (p. 332). Furthermore, such a focus implies a âsystematic disregard of the ways that space may actually be the product of inhabitantsâ ongoing experience and understandingsâ (p. 333). Scholars in the third stream attend to this gap by exploring âhow spaces are produced and manifest in the experiences of those who inhabit themâ (p. 333). The inherent disadvantages are that power relations are overlooked and that the emphasis on perception undervalues the material, physical aspects of space. Logically, therefore, Taylor and Spicer argue for an integrated approach that addresses all three dimensions by building on the ideas of Lefebvre (1974/1991), who sought to bring together mental, physical, and social modalities of space (see also Ford and Harding 2004, p. 817). Although we agree that an integrated approach is needed, this particular proposal does not take some essential concepts into account. Strikingly absent from the organizational literature on space is the work on social space by two of the twentieth centuryâs most influential, and nonconventional, social scientists, the psychologist Kurt Lewin (1936, 1948/1997, 1951/1997) and the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1985, 1989, 1993, 1998; Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). Both placed social space as the cornerstone of their theoretical and methodological work, turning to the philosophical work of Ernst Cassirer (1923/1953, 1944, 1961), who conceived of space in rather relative terms as the positional quality of the material world. Cassirer, Lewin, and Bourdieu adopted the view that there is no empty space, only spaces that are formed by and between objects, and they applied this concept to the creation of social reality rather than to the physical world. At the heart of social space is a relational logic of social reality, which focuses neither on the individual nor the group as the unit of analysis but rather on the processes through which individuals, in interaction with others, construct their social spaces and identities (Friedman, 2011). These interactions are causal loops that link the ways people bring their thinking and feeling into the world through action, to"
72,286,0.171,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Conclusion Despite the complex nature of social innovation processes and the limited theoretical literature exploring the phenomenon, it is clear from the case studies presented here that collective intelligence has a role to play in promoting social innovation, both directly and indirectly. All three of the web platforms examined here promoted social innovation to some extent. Innocentive â the challenge grant example â featured a small sample of social innovation challenges and at least two examples of successfully launched social innovations. OSE â the innovation community example â took a radically alternative model of production and self-sustainability and not only considerably developed the idea with several prototypes, but also created a global shadow network dedicated to taking it further. Finally, TED â the open innovation platform example â publicised several social innovations and helped them to gain greater prominence and resources. TED also created an online community dedicated to seeing some of these socially innovative ideas realised in practice. It has occasionally helped to build cross-scale networks to support the realisation process. At the same time, no single platform seems to be able to support a social innovation from invention through to implementation. In fact, each of these different types of platform seems particularly strong in one particular phase: invention in the case of TED and Innocentive, and development in the case of OSE. Moreover, none of these platforms utilised all of the mechanisms associated with any one phase and none were particularly active in the implementation phase, although TED seems to have the greatest potential in this area. In many ways this reflects the strengths and limitations suggested by the theoretical literature in the introduction to this chapter. Collective intelligence platforms are indeed good at mobilising resources and sharing knowledge and creativity (e.g., TED and OSE); they can help realise the benefits of applying diverse knowledge sets to a single problem (Innocentive); and they are places where truly radical innovation can thrive (OSE). However, they have yet to demonstrate a capacity to be effective in the implementation phase where the ability to navigate complex political environments and form cross-scale networks composed of diverse interest groups becomes crucial. It is interesting to note how successful OSE was at attracting a truly committed group of volunteers willing to invest a significant amount of time and resources into a shared vision. This is contrary to the expectation that online models are best at forming loose networks and this may be linked to the"
277,288,0.171,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"marked by a narrow understanding of integration, dominated by the MoI, the City of Vienna is seen as a focal point for issues related to education, multilingualism and diversity. Fourth, most interaction is happening between similar kinds of actors, i.e. scientists most frequently interact with university actors, NGOs with NGOs and governmental actors with other governmental and semi-governmental actors. The exceptions to this are few in number, and pertain to the interaction between scientists and âminorâ NGOs. However, all types of actors, i.e. scientists, NGOs and governmental actors, are in contact with the social partners, confirming both the de-facto centrality and continuity of the social partners as an influential group of actors in integration policymaking. Topics discussed with the social partners are mainly concentrated on labour market integration and labour rights, but they are also involved in other political issues such as mosque constructions and religious teachersâ education. Unlike the (primarily self-referential) government and nonprofit organisations, the social partners are in contact with a diverse range of actors. These dialogues structures have a huge impact on the question of how knowledge is produced, consumed and utilised. As the MoI promoted the recent institutionalisation process, dialogue structures are certainly marked by this government department. In the area of naturalisation, as could be shown, the dominance of the MoI is such that it successfully claimed knowledge authority and established itself as a knowledge producer. When confronted with Austriaâs low score on naturalisation policy in the MIPEX survey, the MoI not only ignored the scientific critique but re-interpreted it successfully as a vindication of its restrictive policy model. Only in the area of school education, in which the Ministry of Education has competence, does some sort of national dialogue exist. One may thus conclude that the MoI seems to promote the institutionalisation of dialogue structures between science and politics as a means to consolidate and reinforce its primacy in Austrian migrant integration policies. Overall, three different types of knowledge use in the area of migrant integration could be identified in Austrian integration policymaking: legitimising use (to bolster an actorâs political role or authority), substantiating use (to justify decisions and orientations) and knowledge shelving, i.e. when the results of government-funded research are consumed and archived and, eventually, used for decision-making at a later stage. Indications of legitimising knowledge use were most often referred to by interviewees in the field of naturalisation, but ranked high in general. However, the MoI itself stated that it does not have an in-house competence in all issues related to integration and therefore has established the Expert Council to increase its âauthenticityâ. Interviewed experts instead see the set-up of the Expert Council as a justification strategy used by other ministers to gain competence in an area of responsibility. While most interviewees referred to a legitimising use of scientific and expert knowledge, differences between the three topic areas could be identified: in naturalisation, where continued national research is absent and the MoI established itself as a knowledge producer, little need is felt by policymakers for scientific knowledge. The area of education, in contrast, is marked by the active role of boundary actors"
346,395,0.17,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL COGNITION AND HISTORY TEACHING A range of potentially relevant and established social psychological theories can be identified as relevant to history teaching in a divided society, including social categorisation and Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner 1986), stereotype threat (e.g. Steele 1997) and attribution theory (Heider 1958). Categorisation has been dubbed âthe cognitive foundation of all forms of prejudiceâ (Brown 2010, p. viii). Using an information processing analogy, one of the prime strategies used for the purpose of avoiding information overload is categorisation, which allows us to understand the environment rather more easily than if we had to evaluate each stimulus individually to identify it. Categorisation in terms of social cognition, then, is nothing more than the brain taking useful short cuts to understanding. Yet this universal cognitive process has huge implications for those teaching in subject areas such as history, because of its close associations with prejudice via stereotyping and with Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979), which has been widely applied to research in NI. Social Identity Theory research over the last three decades has produced evidence of potential interest to teachers of history and other disciplines where identity issues may be significant. It is now well established that individuals simultaneously hold multiple social identities, may develop new identities and can embrace superordinate identities. In NI, the possible utility of a Northern Irish superordinate identity for reducing sectarian attitudes has long been discussed (Trew 1998). Recent census data (NISRA 2011) indicate that this identification is on the increase although it must be remembered that those espousing a Northern Irish identity might still simultaneously maintain a strong affiliation to traditional British or Irish national identities. As a result of research in contested spaces, it is argued that a âhotâ rather than a banal form of national identity (Billig 1995) is actively constructed (Stevenson and Muldoon 2010) although as Skey (2009) points out these are neither fixed nor discrete, and Jones and Merriman (2009) have suggested âeveryday nationalismâ as an alternative, more dynamic term combining banal and hot elements. In such circumstances, it is clear that the same contextual information (such as historical events) may be construed by different groups (including political actors) to support"

Qualitative representations can then be iteratively improved. Modeling phenomena with mathematics includes setting up an equation that describes the phenomena. It is important to note that effective problem solvers do not solely model problems qualitatively or quantitatively; rather, they use both sorts of representation, as each informs the other and together can lead to a more effective solution and solution process (Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Van Heuvelen & Zou, 2001). For example, after creating a qualitative model, one may proceed to create a quantitative model. The finished qualitative model will influence how the quantitative model is set up. One should then see where the models are consistent, and where they contradict each other; in this way, the models can be progressively improved. By spending adequate time modeling, one can engage in more effective problem-solving, as it guides subsequent investigations, can activate solution schemas, and can provide the framework by which one can simulate what would happen when a variable is manipulated (Anzai & Yokoyama, 1984; Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Sins, Savelsbergh, & van Joolingen, 2005). Just as it is important to learn to create models, it is also important to be able to interpret the models created by others, especially in terms of what these diverse models say differently about the underlying problems (diSessa, 1988; Seufert, 2003; Wu, Krajcik, & Soloway, 2001). Doing so can lead to enhanced understanding of the problem (Seufert, 2003). This is particularly challenging for K-12 students (BrÃ¥ten et al., 2011; Seufert, 2003). Indeed, learners often simply adhere to the model that is closest to their own early experiences, or the simplest explanation of the underlying phenomenon, even when presented with a more accurate model (diSessa, 1988; Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). This may be explained in part by most K-12 studentsâ lack of familiarity with complex causal models, such as those that explain changes in a factor through indirect action from a combination of factors A and B (Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). While some evidence indicates that reluctance to consider an alternative model is widespread among learners of differing levels of prior knowledge and skill, other evidence indicates that it may be more prevalent among lower-achieving students (Seufert, 2003). Thus, it is especially important to endeavor to increase modeling skills from a social justice vantage point and to broaden participation in STEM (Lynch, 2001). 4.2.1.4.2.3 Argumentation Science is very much a social endeavor, as no scientist works in a vacuum (Ford, 2012). Rather, scientists work in a large community of practice in which they share and defend findings to one another, and build off of othersâ work. At the core of this is argumentation, defined as both backing claims with evidence and models, but also effectively evaluating claims on the basis of evidence and models (Ford, 2012; Osborne, 2010). The argumentation process allows scientific models and theories to be iteratively improved (Ford, 2012). To be able to engage in STEM effectively as citizens, individuals also need to be able to engage in clear argumentation (Aufschnaiter et al., 2008; Jonassen, 2011; Osborne, 2010; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958). For example, when scientific issues are discussed, citizens need to be able to sort out well-founded claims from"
99,241,0.17,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In this chapter, we have described the transition of the ongoing welfare policies governance system in Milan over recent decades. Milan as a case study yields understanding of the barriers that local governments, especially in the countries most affected by the recession, face in promoting a system of governance oriented to social innovation, and in which social policies (even if weak) are supposed to play an important role in promoting local development. After many years of profound changes, Milan has currently reached deadlock in terms of policy innovation. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the city was highly dynamic in terms of welfare provision, given that the municipal government was a central actor in designing and providing social services as tools for economic and social development. From the 1990s to 2011, the municipal government instead played a weak role as director of a system of governance in which welfare was residual and was based on the involvement of non-profit and private organizations, but only as providers. During those two decades, the right-wing coalition governing Milan adopted a basically market-oriented style of governance (Molotch and Vicari 2009). The period was dominated by the rhetoric that creation of a âgood business climateâ was an effective way to foster growth and innovation but also to eradicate poverty and to deliver, in the long run, higher standards of living to the mass of the population (Harvey 1989). However, those years were marked by a huge increase in the social inequalities characterizing the social structure of the city (DâOvidio 2009). In 2011, municipal elections rewarded a new coalition proposing a style of governance more oriented to a âsocial innovation approachâ. However, the difficult financial situation inherited by the municipality from the past, and austerity measures imposed by the national government, have reduced the ambitions of the current municipal government in regard to social policies. In this chapter, we have highlighted that values expressed in the welfare plan have not yet been translated into effective actions. According to this document, for example, welfare measures are important investments for local development âthat the rhetoric of the economic crisis is not supposed to limitâ (Municipality of Milan 2012, p. 5). However, the efforts to respect the Stability Pact have greatly restricted welfare investments. Moreover, the municipal government has been pressurizing the national government to redesign the Stability Pact so that it was able to afford the public costs of the forthcoming International Expo 2015, while pressures to support welfare services have been weaker. Indeed, also the new municipal government regards this event as the main chance for the cityâs future economic and social development. Within the dimensions proposed by Cattacin and Zimmer in Chap. 2 of this volume, we can argue that Milan has been following a pattern of local development based on a concurrence of public investment in economic or social initiatives, while the rhetoric and values of the electoral campaign and the coalition programme have been more oriented to governance of social innovation."
99,25,0.17,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"problems and the local political decision-making process allows for policy solutions to be developed. Another reason for consensus is economic growth, important for all cities and enhancing the quality of life of residents, usually linked to social inclusion. Although social policy coordination in Birmingham is characterised by partnerships, decisions are not usually implemented without the involvement of local government. The chapter about Geneva by Patricia Naegeli shows that Genevaâs governance arrangements are built on a strong local and cantonal state that uses the support of subsidised non-profit organisations in order to implement local welfare decisions. In the Swiss context, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity, this is quite an exception. It can be explained by a strong public administration that influences all local welfare decisions in a conservative way and the presence of a relative consensus among political forces to have âgenerousâ social policies. Yet since the 2000s, newcomer parties have challenged political stability and long-lasting conflicting debates within the city council and the cantonal parliament. Both the influence of neighbouring France, where social policies are centralised and state-oriented and the strong economy of Geneva that can finance âgenerousâ social measures are part of the explanation. However, in the governance of social challenges, social innovation tends to be incremental, and seems to happen within the public sector or at least, under the guidance of the local or cantonal state. Milan, the focus of the chapter by Giuliana Costa, Roberta Cucca and Rossana Torri, can be described as a city lost in transition. For more than two decades, Milan has been ruled by a strongly market-oriented system of governance, following the rhetoric that creating a âgood business climateâ is not only an effective way to foster growth and innovation, but also to eradicate poverty and to deliver higher standards of living. This approach has led to (a) a disinvestment in welfare services directly provided by the municipality, in favour of a more residual welfare system based on non-profit and private involvement and (b) a huge investment in neo-liberal tools of government for the economic development of the city, such as the promotion of international events (Expo2015) and large real estate investments through publicâprivate partnerships. After some scandals as well as a huge increase of social inequalities, municipal elections rewarded a new coalition following a style of governance oriented to a social innovation approach. However, the difficult financial situation of the municipality has reduced ambitions of the current government. The chapter by Benjamin Ewert on Berlin shows that for a long time the city benefitted immensely from the myth to be âpoor but sexyâ. The popular slogan, referring to the coexistence of impoverishment and creativity in the city, expressed very well the Berlin Zeitgeist promising âa good life for little moneyâ. Hence the city has been a home for creative workers, artists, cosmopolitans and young people from all over the world, literally speaking âchange agentsâ that sustainably co-designed Berlin as a place for unconventional life styles and innovative solutions for everyday challenges. This chapter argues, however, that Berlinâs sources for innovative capital may dry up in the near future due to the re-emergence of social challenges that tend to eclipse the improvements emanating from social innovations. There are very different ways of giving innovatory practices and organisations a preliminary place in the architecture of public policies and forms of governance. A new system"

From the point of view of an observant social scientist, the situation after the 2004 reformation at the UTNEM was just an âadditionâ of the social scientific part, appropriately suggested by the prospectus cited above. This addition model was not a totally meaningless change, of course, but it was not sufficient to cope with contemporary difficult issues centering around nuclear utilization in a so-called post-industrial society. This process of âintegrationâ seems to require a long-term effort to be accomplished. The Fukushima Daiichi accident clearly exposed the incompleteness of the past efforts at âintegration,â as various chapters of this book discuss in detail; even in 2014, three years after the accident, it seems to be still on going. The abilities required of leading engineers in this post-industrial era are not just to pursue technological development as prescribed (typically by governmental long-term plans or other national programs), but to grasp multi-dimensional needs for technology, to develop technology in collaboration with different stakeholders under a more open societal process, and to fulfill their social responsibility in compliance with values shared within society."
192,94,0.17,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"it is actually a play about science, first and foremost about astronomy (cf. Olson and Olson 1998). More precisely, the play stages a collision between scholarship and politics, as well as between the discourse of the Master and university discourse. This schema will be further elucidated with the help of a second literary case study namely Carmen, published in 1845, a novel about an archaeologist who travels to Andalusia, but deflects from his research because of an encounter with a different kind of object a (namely the gaze and voice of a living being, instead of an archaeological find: a â a), so that his scholarly research becomes transformed into an âarchaeology of the presentâ (i.e. psychoanalytical discourse). The final two literary documents to be discussed in this chapter date from the late nineteenth century and are written by two contemporaries, namely Henrik Ibsen (1828â1906) and Jules Verne (1828â1905). Henrik Ibsen is generally regarded as one of the greatest psychologists of world literature and as a precursor of psychoanalysis. His oeuvre represents a literary psychoanalytical clinic avant la lettre. Indeed, as Lacan phrases it, Freudâs oeuvre, focussing on human desire and gender relationships, emerges in âle contexte ibsÃ©nien de la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cleâ (Lacan 1986, p. 18). But Ibsenâs plays also analyse how science and technology transform the world of fin-de-siÃ¨cle culture. In other words, whereas most Ibsen scholars use his dramas to study issues in the realm of psychology and gender, I see his prose plays as literary laboratories, so that Ghosts explores end-of-life decisions and genetics (Zwart 1993), while The Wild Duck studies the emergence of photography and animal research (Zwart 2000b) and The Lady from the Sea reflects the impact of cruise steamers on art and tourism (Zwart 2015c). Enemy of the People (1882/1978), the play that will be discussed in this chapter, raises the question how researchers may safeguard their integrity while navigating a complicated societal landscape. The title already refers to the question whether scientists are benefactors or enemies of the people, or both. To explain Verneâs role in this book, some misunderstandings regarding his work must be addressed. First of all, although Jules Verne is often regarded as the âfather of science fictionâ, most of his novels (rather than anticipating the future) actually address scientific and technological developments of his own era, so that his novels contribute to a diagnostics of the present. And indeed, in his immense oeuvre (encompassing ninety novels) a panoramic encyclopaedia of research fields and research technologies is fleshed out (Zwart 2008a, p. 233 ff.). Moreover, Verne sees technologies not only as products of science (which are subsequently transferred into the societal realm), but first and foremost as enablers of research. Nemoâs submarine and the capsule that is designed to travel to the moon, to mention just two examples, are basically mobile laboratories, which allow researchers to conduct their experiments while moving towards the things themselves (Zu den Sachen selbst), allowing them to attain unprecedented proximity. In other words, what Verne reveals in his novels is the technicity of science, emphasising the crucial role of instruments and machinery. He describes how new research practices are opened up by new contrivances. Indeed, most of the machinery described in his novels is used for scientific exploration and experimentation. Also, Verne is often mistaken for an unequivocal advocate of science whereas in fact his attitude towards science"

364,24,0.169,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Effective measures for managing risks and promoting sustainability call for trans-disciplinary, multi-partnership, multi-dimensional research (Dedeurwaerdere 2013; Earth System Governance Project (ESGP) 2012). Spearheaded by the International Council for Science (ICSU) and others, the newly launched Future Earth sustainability research initiative is expected to play a key role in providing a reinforced, overarching framework for sustainability science (Yasunari 2013). The platform for enhancing the science-policy interface needs to be bolstered by building upon the prototype recently provided by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Takeuchi 2013). Sciences that address risks and sustainability are changing to involve multiple actors in addressing issues from a trans-disciplinary perspective across a wider range of temporal and spatial scales (Benn et al. 2008). Universities must be pivotal players in transforming the platform of trans-disciplinary science to support risk management and the promotion of sustainability."
277,299,0.169,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"integration issue, taking place in the context of a debate on Italian identity and against multiculturalism triggered by the reactions to 9/11 and terrorist events in Europe. In this politicised climate, the centre-left majority elected in May 2006 proposed a new culturalist approach to migrant integration, as highlighted by the drafting of the Charter of the Values of Citizenship and Integration promoted by the then Minister of the Interior Giuliano Amato. The Charter was initially presented as a reaction to a controversial initiative of the Union of Islamic Communities in Italy (UCOII) to publish an advertisement in the main Italian newspapers comparing Israeli repression in the Palestinian territories to the Nazi Holocaust. However, the Minister enlarged its scope by affirming that it had to be endorsed by individuals applying for Italian nationality more generally.1 Integration was presented as a process requiring migrants to âshow a good command of the Italian language, know the essential elements of Italian history and culture and share the principles regulating the Italian society.â (Carta dei valori della cittadinanza e dellâintegrazione â principle no. 5). This culturalist shift was at the very core of Law no. 94, known as the âSecurity Packageâ (Pacchetto sicurezza) and approved by the fourth Berlusconi government in July 2009. Integration was defined as a âprocess aiming at promoting cohabitation between Italian and foreign citizens on the basis of respect for the Italian Constitution, with a mutual engagement to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of the societyâ (art. 4-bis). The so-called âIntegration Agreementâ was also introduced, requiring signature by first-time applicants for the residence permit. The Integration Agreement requires immigrants to fulfil specific integration conditions within 2 years in order to have their residence permit renewed, with a particular emphasis on the mastery of the Italian language and on the knowledge of the countryâs history, institutions, and civic culture. This cultural definition of integration was further emphasised in the document âIntegration and security programme. Identity and encounterâ (Piano integrazione nella sicurezza. IdentitÃ  e incontro), approved by the government in June 2010, where a so-called âOpen identityâ model of integration (Modello dellâidentitÃ  aperta) was proposed. This model favoured the âpursuit of a real encounter implying an understanding and respect for who we are, reciprocated by a natural curiosity towards othersâ cultures and traditionsâ (p. 5). The respect of âwho we are,â that is of âour cultural identity,â defined as âan original combination of Jewish-Christian and Roman-Greek culturesâ (p. 4), is regarded as an essential pre-condition in order to start a path towards integration based on ârights and obligations, responsibilities and opportunitiesâ (p. 4). However, the Integration Agreement was implemented only in March 2012, i.e., more than 2 years after it was introduced, and it has not challenged regional autonomy on matters of migrant integration. In fact, integration policy in Italy"
