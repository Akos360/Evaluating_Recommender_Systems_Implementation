291,65,0.253,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"6.2 Results Figures 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20, and 6.21 (pages 46â65) depict Lexis diagrams of rates of mortality improvements (âROMIsâ), which are the time derivative of age-specific death rates. We argue that those maps are better able to illustrate mortality dynamics than the commonly used âheat mapsâ of mortality. We plotted our first ROMIs on the Lexis surface about 10 years ago (Rau et al. 2008). In the meantime, those plots have become more commonplace, especially among actuaries, to visualize mortality dynamics. Our method can be considered as a descriptive tool. It is able to detect the predominant dynamics of mortality (or of any other phenomenon measured on the Lexis surface). We think that those âROMIâ-maps provide better insights into mortality dynamics than standard surface maps but are equally intuitively understandable. During the 1950s, the first years of our observation period, survival improved tremendously especially for infants, children, and young adults. The most remarkable declines in mortality were recorded for Japanese females (Fig. 6.14, page 58). After the end of World War II, life expectancy in Japan was below the average of western European countries. According to data from the Human Mortality Database, life expectancy for Japanese females rose from 60.9 years in 1950 to 72.3 in 1963. Thus, life expectancy increased by almost 1 year within each calendar year during that time span! But also France (Fig. 6.9, p. 53), Italy (Fig. 6.13, p. 57), England & Wales (Fig. 6.7, p. 51) or the United States (Fig. 6.21, p. 65), to name only a few, gained several years of life due to mortality declines at younger ages."

291,127,0.242,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The goal of this monograph was to show a variety of possibilities to visualize mortality dynamics on the Lexis plane. While we provided examples of raw and smoothed mortality surfaces, our focus was on visualizing rates of mortality improvement (âROMIsâ), i.e., the derivative of age-specific death rates with respect to time. We provided ROMI examples for national populations covered by the Human Mortality Database as well as for selected causes of death in the United States. These âROMI-plotsâ were quite instructive to detect period and cohort effects. We also illustrated how changes in age-specific mortality contribute to a gain (or loss) in life expectancy. In Chap. 9 we decomposed seasonal data for causes of death to investigate whether the seasonal pattern, measured via the amplitude and the peak moment (âphaseâ), has changed over or age. The previous chapter dealt with survival chances of persons who were diagnosed with cancer. Despite the large number of figures, our list is obviously not exhaustive; here we want to provide a few more two ideas how the Lexis diagram can be used to illustrate not only mortality dynamics. Figure 11.1 adapts our ROMI approach to fertility. The top panel contains a surface map of age-specific fertility rates in the eastern part of Germany. Birth counts and corresponding exposures by single year of age and calendar time were downloaded from the Human Fertility Database (2017). The estimates were (again) generated with Camardaâs R package for smoothing surfaces with P-splines"

The simulation is performed in the same conditions as Fig. 13.2. The profile of the SIIR curve in Fig. 13.2 looks the same as the curve in Fig. 13.3. Therefore, the cause of the discontinuous final size distribution is the division of the infection period into two stages, and the mobility of I has no effect on the discontinuity."

353,231,0.224,"Disability, Health and Human Development","LICs have the highest adult mortality rates in the world (Rajaratnam et al. 2010), and reducing premature adult mortality rates is fundamental to improve wellbeing and to promote sustainable development. Yet data on adult mortality is severely lacking in LICs, as they often do not have vital registry systems. Population-based surveys can offer a way of assessing the overall health of a population (e.g., Rathod et al. 2016). The objective of this section is to use longitudinal population-level data on mortality collected as part of the LSMS in Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda to investigate the association between functional difficulty, on the one hand, and short term mortality, on the other. If important associations are found, then functional difficulty indicators may be considered as potential indicators of vulnerability to mortality for policy purposes. 6.3.1"

275,389,0.22,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"In this case it was performed by training the Convnet on USPS training data only and then tested on USPS test data, MNIST test data and DIGITS test data. For the experiment 1280 USPS training images only were used. Test data used included 8192 MNIST test images, 1024 USPS test images, and 4096 DIGITS test images. The results are shown in Tables 13.7, 13.8, 13.9, 13.10, 13.11 and 13.12 inclusive. Tables 13.7, 13.9, and 13.11 show the confusion matrix achieved using the standard classifier on MNIST, USPS and DIGITS test databases with average error rates 0.897, 0.957, and 0.692, respectively. These errors are contrasted with Tables 13.8, 13.10, and 13.12 which show the achieved error performance for test 6 using the new objective function on MNIST, USPS and DIGITS test databases with average error rates of 0.784, 0.893 and 0.538 respectively. As expected, test 6 resulted in some increase in the average errors in all cases. Notably, the misclassifications for each of these databases show significantly different characteristics to what is now seen trained on USPS data. Pivot points for the MNIST test are different to those earlier, now with confusions (7,2) and (6,4) as most significant. Pivot points for the DIGITS test have significant confusions (7,2), (9,3), (1,4) and (1,7). Examining the objective to minimise errors in row 7, this is demonstrated in all three cases. Error confusion (7,2) were reduced from 117 to 31, and 220 to 130 in the MNIST and DIGITS tests and remained the same at 2 for the USPS test. Errors for column 4 increased from 212 to 460 and 204 to 278 for MNIST and DIGITS tests, and from 3 to 20 for the USPS test. This largely fulfilled the aim of the test, however, there are several notable âsurprisesâ. Table 13.8 shows significant error increases for (0,2), (0,6), and (1,6) compared with Table 13.7. Table 13.12 shows significant error increases for (0,2), (2,6) and (4,9)."
291,62,0.21,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"6.1 From Smoothed Death Rates to Rates of Mortality Improvement The colors and contour lines in Fig. 5.3 suggest also a change in pace over time: Each level of mortality seems to change its slope in the early 1990s. We argue that those trend changes are better illustrated with ârates of mortality improvementâ, which we labeled âROMISâ, than with (smoothed) surface maps of mortality.

180,151,0.201,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Preterm births, the leading cause of infant mortality, are increasing annually worldwide (World Health Organization 2012). The United States shares company with Nigeria, India, and Brazil among the top ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births and ranks 31st among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations in infant mortality (OECD 2010). Within the United States, racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality remain entrenched and have increased (MacDorman and Mathews 2009). U.S. health policy leaders have made the elimination of health disparities a top public health priority (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2011). Infant mortality is an important area of focus for eliminating disparities, both in its own right and because the rate of infant mortality serves as an indicator of the nationâs health due to its association with maternal health, social and economic conditions, racial discrimination, access to health care, and public health practices (MacDorman and Mathews 2009). During the twentieth century, U.S. infant mortality declined 93 % (MacDorman 2011). In 1900, about 100 infants died per 1000 live births. By 2000, that number fell to 6.89. During the last half of the twentieth century, the rate of black infant mortality dropped dramatically. In 1950, black infant mortality was 43.9 deaths per 1000 live births compared with 26.8 deaths per 1000 live births among whites (Mechanic 2002). But by 1998 black infant mortality fell to 13.8 deaths per 1000 live births compared with 6.0 deaths per 1000 live births among whites. As these numbers show, both groups made significant absolute gains, with blacks gaining more in absolute termsâa reduction of 30.1 for blacks and 20.8 for whites. Yet, black infant mortality still remained about twice that of whites."
260,131,0.201,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"While LMBV grew slightly faster at 30 Â°C than 25 Â°C, it did not replicate past one day in cell culture when held at 35 Â°C, probably because largemouth bass typically inhabit aquatic systems that do not exceed 30 Â°C (Eaton and Scheller 1996; Grant et al. 2003). Thus, there is strong evidence that ranavirus replication is highly temperature- and host-dependent (Speare and Smith 1992; Grant et al. 2003; Rojas et al. 2005; Ariel et al. 2009b). To the extent that replication in vitro represents replication rates in vivo, we would expect that the rates of viral replication and host mortality would generally increase with temperature. Results from several studies are consistent with this hypothesis. In experimental water bath challenges of adult redfin perch, all of the fish held at water temperatures of 12â21 Â°C died, while those at 6â10 Â°C either did not become infected or quickly cleared the infection (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995). Experimental challenges of European stocks of redfin perch and rainbow trout with EHNV also found that mortality increased with temperature (from 15 to 20 Â°C), and significant mortality was not observed at 10 Â°C (Ariel and Jensen 2009). Similarly, Bayley et al. (2013) reported >96 % mortality of the common frog tadpoles exposed to ranaviruses (FV3 [Frog virus 3] or REV [Rana esculenta virus]) at 20 Â°C but <32 % when exposed to ranaviruses at 15 Â°C. A contrasting pattern was observed in a study conducted with larval tiger salamanders and ATV (Rojas et al. 2005). Larvae exposed to ATV and reared at 10 or 18 Â°C experienced >80 % mortality, while larvae reared at 26 Â°C experienced <38 % mortality. Viral titers were higher in salamanders that died at 10 Â°C than 18 Â°C, suggesting that colder temperature may have suppressed immune responses to ATV. There is also evidence in turtles that temperature influences the outcome of infection. Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) infected with FV3 experienced 100 % mortality at 22 Â°C but 50 % mortality at 28 Â°C (Allender et al. 2013b). Additionally, time to death was shorter and viral loads greater in turtles at 22 Â°C compared to those at 28 Â°C. Allender et al. (2013b) hypothesized that cell-mediated or humoral immune responses could be enabling turtles to clear infections at higher temperatures. Instead of focusing on the kinetics of viral replication and host immune responses, temperature could be a stressor in and of itself. Bayley et al. (2013) found greater mortality in R. temporaria tadpoles held at 20 Â°C than at 15 Â°C when exposed to FV3, PPIV (Pike perch iridovirus), and REV, but mortality was also greater at 20 Â°C in the unexposed control animals, suggesting that the higher temperature was generally stressful. Several fish challenges have shown increased mortality at temperatures near the fishesâ thermal limits (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995; Grant et al. 2003). Ariel and Jensen (2009) noted that mortality in rainbow trout exposed to EHNV was highest at 20 Â°C, which is beyond the natural temperature range for this species and likely stressful or immunosuppressive. The redfin perch in their study, however, experienced the greatest mortality at intermediate temperaturesâtwice as much at 15 Â°C than 20 Â°C, and very little at 10 Â°Câso temperature-induced stress appears not to be important in this species. Perhaps viral replication was favored at 15 Â°C more than the hostâs immune system, whereas the immune system was dominant at 20 Â°C (Ariel and Jensen 2009). Similarly, Echaubard et al. (2014) found that the rate of mortality in experimental epidemics with northern leopard frog and wood"

Table 5.2 lists the main âcausesâ of maternal deaths in Mulago National Referral Hospital in the 12 months from January 2012 to December 2012: The data presented here should not be regarded as âfacts.â Certainly each maternal death recorded here is a sad fact but the process of establishing (single factor) causation is highly problematic. Signiï¬cant pressure fuelled by SVP volunteers has encouraged a process of maternal mortality review, but compliance across the HUB remains patchy. As such, all facility-generated data must be regarded as a social construction.10 Nevertheless, it serves one of the most important functions of quantitative data: it indicates trends and raises critical questions. During the early months of the LMP project (and very much playing the role of handmaiden to the obstetrician lead) we took it at face value that these were the causes of maternal deaths rather than the ï¬nal âhitâ on the protracted âroad to deathâ (Filippi et al. 2005). Faced with the alarming volume of maternal and neonatal deaths occurring in these referral facilities and the earlier âevidenceâ on causation, it may come as no surprise that the overwhelming initial response was to advocate the introduction of (imported/amended) protocols and Table 5.2 Causes and frequencies of maternal deaths in Mulago (Jan-12 to Dec-12) Causes of death Abortion Eclampsia Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) Anaemia Ruptured uterus HIV-related Respiratory distress Cardiac arrest on table Puerperal sepsis Malaria in pregnancy Tetanus Ruptured ectopic Dead on arrival Total Source: McKay and Ackers 2013."

372,1642,0.193,Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy : Third Edition (Edition 3),"For longer baselines, other power laws will be more appropriate. With the frozen-screen approximation, the power-law exponent can be determined from the power spectrum of the fluctuations. An example is shown in Fig. 13.17 (see also Bolton et al. 2011). Thus, in extrapolating D+ .d/ from a singlespacing measurement, one does not have to depend on the theoretical values of the exponent of d but can use the measurements of D+ .&/ to determine the range and variation [see Eq. (13.108) and Table 13.2]. For the example shown in Fig. 13.17, the power-law slope for frequencies above 0.01 Hz is 2.5, slightly below the value of 8/3 or 2.67 predicted for Kolmogorov turbulence. The spectrum flattens at frequencies below 0.01 Hz because of the filtering effect of the interferometer. Fluctuations larger than the baseline, 100 m in this case, cause little phase effect. For the corner frequency fc D vs =d, the wind speed along the baseline direction can be inferred to be about 1 m s!1 . Table 13.4 shows a compilation of the measurements of the structure function referred to a baseline of 100 m. The range of values reported for a fiducial baseline"

On the contrary, studies of wildlife mortality on railway tracks are scarce and have focused primarily on a few large mammals, such as moose and bears. Nevertheless, many species are found as victims of collisions with trains, although certain taxonomic groups, such as amphibians and reptiles, and/or small bodied species are reported infrequently and their mortality is probably underestimated. However, no assessment of population impacts is known for railways. Keywords Wildlife mortality"

291,42,0.186,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"3.1.2 Cause-Specific Death Counts in the United States The National Center for Health Statistics of the United States provides a unique collection: Individual death counts by sex, age at death, year of death, cause of death, and many more characteristics can be freely downloaded from its web page. The data are available since 1968 in annual files. Additionally, the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) provides data since 1959, which we used in our analyses. The last year in our analysis is 2014. With the exception of 1972, when only a 50% sample was taken, each file contains all deaths in the United States. In the analysis by cause of death in later chapters of this volume, we simply multiplied the number of deaths for a given age, sex, and cause in the year 1972 by a factor of 2. Causes of death are coded by the so-called âInternational Classification of Diseasesâ (ICD). Since its introduction in the late nineteenth century, the system has been revised at irregular intervals (MeslÃ© 2006). The tenth revision is currently used. During the first years of our analysis, ICD-7 was used. ICD-8 was in effect in the United States between 1968 and 1978, followed by ICD-9 from 1979 until 1998. Obtaining consistent time series of causes of death across ICD revisions requires meticulous work and care (e.g., MeslÃ© and Vallin 1996; PechholdovÃ¡ 2009). We therefore decided to use only very broad categories for causes of death and followed primarily the coding of Janssen et al. (2003) and of MeslÃ© and Vallin (2006a). Both papers include an appendix with detailed ICD codes across the four revisions required in our analysis. Table 3.2 is split into two halves. The upper panel provides the ICD codes we used to extract the causes of death, whereas the lower panel lists the number of deaths in absolute and relative terms for the selected causes by sex. Our database consists of more than 118 million deaths. Although we have selected very few causes, they account for about three quarters of all deaths (Category 13 âOtherâ is 23.75%). A bit more than 44% of all deaths classified as originating from circulatory diseases. In that category, heart diseases are about one third of all deaths for women and men alike.
