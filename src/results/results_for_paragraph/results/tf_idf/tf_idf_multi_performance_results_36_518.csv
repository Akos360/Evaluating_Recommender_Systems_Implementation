246,312,0.267,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Ever since the creation of national parks and other large-scale nature conservation efforts, the principal objectives of conservation, science, and recreation are bound together in an ever-changing interrelated triangle. Their dependencies, benefits and tensions are in a constant flow, often defined by financial contexts (Kupper 2009). This is also discernible in the current European situation of dwindling subsidies and uncertain finances for nature conservation, which calls for conservation activities that generate revenues to achieve economically sustainable conservation. Several actors in European wilderness conservation are adopting conservation strategies that aim to achieve economic sustainability. For instance, Rewilding Europe included wilderness-based entrepreneurship in their main objectives (see Chap. 9), and the NGO Wild Europe (wildeurope.org) launched an economic benefits group in 2013 to stimulate âa new breed of wilderness warriorâ. Due to the rise of these new European wide conservation initiatives there is a need to train students and professionals in wilderness entrepreneurship. Nature conservationists are traditionally not trained in entrepreneurship and business development as it is often assumed that professions related to nature conservation are principally guided by ecological and sustainable principles. Those fields therefore define the educational design of nature conservation curricula. This chapter describes an exploration into this new field of education in the context of rewilding European abandoned agricultural land."

169,698,0.235,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"pillars: sustainable water management, urban and industrial water stewardship, climate change adaptation, and habitat and biodiversity conservation. Implemented across seven districts of Uttar Pradesh with a geographical focus on the 300 km stretch of the Ramganga (Kalagarh to Hardoi) and the 900 km stretch of the Ganga (Bijnor to Varanasi), this program envisions Ganga and Ramganga as healthy river systems rich in biodiversity and aims to provide long-term water security to communities, businesses, and nature. This builds on WWF-Indiaâs work in the Ganga basin since 1997 with conservation of aquatic biodiversity and the Living Ganga Program (2007â2012), which developed strategies for sustainable energy and water resource management in a critical stretch of 800 km from Gangotri to Kanpur. To restore the ecological health of the rivers, the program works with a diverse range of stakeholders across academia, government institutions, policy makers, civil society members, local communities, and businesses to implement its multidisciplinary conservation strategy. The involvement of various partners, including religious leaders, government departments, and NGOs, in the project, the improvement in the livelihood of the local people, and the riverine habitat have provided additional acceptability for WWF-Indiaâs work. Awareness of the local community toward the environment has helped greatly in motivating the community to work for conservation and climate change adaptation. Studies on water availability and water quality in the Ganga and Ramganga Rivers are being carried out in order to understand the factors determining the ï¬exibility and resilience of ecosystems, including the habitat preference of species, river connectivity and quality, ï¬ow regimes, disturbances, and mortality of the aquatic biodiversity, especially of Ganges river dolphins, gharials, and freshwater turtles. Under the RfLLfR program, the development of a data base and research through GIS and remote sensing is an extremely valuable asset that will support further research and will help to formulate adaptation strategies where required, with the long-term goal to save the ecosystem. The lessons learned from WWF-Indiaâs intervention, particularly its strategy with regard to garnering support from the local communities, has been widely disseminated and accepted by the government and local people as a replicable model."
320,315,0.224,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"10.6.5 Working Step: Stakeholder Involvement, Communication and Participation Many conflicts in protected areas are caused by land-users and other stakeholders not accepting the objectives and measures of nature conservation because they stand contrary to their interests. It is essential to include and integrate those stakeholders and land users in the process of adaptation. This is vital for the increase of acceptance and to find win-win-solutions that help all parties involved to adapt to climate change. To foster stakeholder involvement existing conflicts and problems with land-users and stakeholders have to be analysed and documented, and suitable strategies for participation and communication must be identified. Furthermore, land-users and other stakeholders will also have to adapt to climate change (for example, artificial irrigation to avoid drought, or snow cannons to extend tourist seasons). Such autonomous adaptation activities might not even be directly attributed to climate change. However, they can be in conflict with protection efforts, increase existing problems or even create new threats to conservation goals. Hence, the autonomous adaptation of stakeholders should be monitored and guided by conservation management. Successful adaptation to climate change requires the close cooperation of diverse stakeholders, land-users, administrators, and scientists. Each of the"

Conserving the Umayyad Royal Narrative in Qusayr Ê¿Amra Gaetano Palumbo Abstract This chapter focuses on the work of conservation at the site of Qusayr âAmra, a bathhouse located 80 km east of Amman, in Jordan. The site was built by the Umayyad prince Walid b. Yazid during the caliphate of his uncle Hisham, probably between 730 and 743 AD (111â125 H.), and its interior walls are covered by mural paintings. I explore how archaeology and conservation have contributed or interfered with the understanding of the monument, and how authenticity can be deï¬ned in a site that has seen at least three major conservation interventions. It will also discuss whether the paintings can really be deï¬ned as âIslamic Art,â ï¬tting a narrative of royal power that uses symbols and iconographies that are borrowed from the cultures that preceded the arrival of Islam in the region.

364,454,0.21,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"designated either as Urbanization-Restricted Areas or Agriculture Promotion Areas. However farmlands and forests in the Kanagawa region are rapidly decreasing due to urbanization and industrial development. In the areas closest to the urban districts the encroachment of housing and manufacturing damages the landscape of rural areas. Inside satoyama areas aging farmers give up farming and forestry and their children move away to work in offices. This results in the devastation of rural landscapes. To save satoyama areas from this deterioration the Kanagawa Prefectural Government enacted a bylaw in 2007, and this was followed by the Satoyama Conservation Action Plan in 2009. The Satoyama Conservation Bylaw aims to enrich peopleâs wellbeing by developing the multiple functions of satoyama in Kanagawa. Satoyama have a multifaceted significance, providing seasonal scenery, biodiversity, cultural heritage, fresh air, safe food, disaster relief, etc. The bylaw underscores the role of community and municipal government in the conservation of satoyama landscapes. It is the prefectural government that selects âSatoyama Conservation Areasâ and accredits âSatoyama Conservation Partnership Agreementsâ between landowners and local action groups. The prefectural government provides financial and technical assistance for local action groups, who purchase grass cutters and chainsaws using subsidies. The Agriculture Division of Kanagawa Prefectural Government hosts programs to raise public awareness of satoyama among people of different generations, including farming experience programs for school children, satoyama symposiums, and other initiatives. In the Action Plan the prefectural government set the goal of selecting 16 conservation areas and 20 partnership agreements by 2013. By 2012 13 areas had been designated as Satoyama conservation sites and 14 local action groups had established Satoyama Conservation Partnership Agreements to engage in satoyama conservation activities (see Fig. 20.1). They range from the smallest Ishikawa-Maruyama area (12 ha) to the largest Kuno area (2,800 ha). The larger areas include mountain forests, while farmlands are relatively modest in size and divided into small plots. Some mountain forests are the common property of landowners. Based on the established partnership agreements, action groups borrow the abandoned farmlands and forest from the landowners to rehabilitate them for use (see Fig. 20.2). Besides the rehabilitation of farmlands and forest, local action groups have utilized the resources of satoyama landscapes in different ways as shown in Table 20.1. The most popular activity is environmental education. Local action groups invite school teachers and students to their satoyama areas to provide a âfieldâ for the study of nature and biodiversity. There is a growing interest in a âhands-onâ approach to environmental education among school teachers, and satoyama offer them the ideal opportunity for this. In some areas action groups hold various events with the local neighborhood organizations to teach traditional knowledge and cultural heritage such as traditional cooking, toys, and crafts to small children. In the Kuno area of Odawara City the action group invites children and their parents living in the city center to plant soba (buckwheat) as shown in Fig. 20.3. After planting the soba a member of the action group plays educational nature games with the children to teach them the various species of insects."

246,319,0.206,Rewilding European Landscapes,"retirees were encountered. Meetings with various local stakeholders were organized to discuss the problems and possible alternatives for regional development and nature conservation. Among stakeholders were: the NGOs responsible for the local nature reserves and Rewilding Europe; mayors of Portuguese and Spanish villages; the president of a hunting association, local entrepreneurs such as producers and retailers of cheese, jam, almonds, wine, and Iberian pig meat products; and the owners of a bar and a bed & breakfast. The main assignment for the IP students was to explore economic dynamics that could contribute to the ecological restoration and future wilderness in the region. In groups of three to four, they articulated a vision for the region, together with a business model that would give both the ecological system and the local community new perspectives. Many of the business models that students produced were in the tourism sector, which is in line with what Rewilding Europe promotes in this region (see Chap. 9). Some student groups perceived the lack of publicity for the area as its main problem. Therefore, they came up with a web portal for local (tourism) enterprises and a marketing brand for the whole region. They also came up with models to expand the local variety of tourist activities. One group proposed to diversify the local economy by introducing a snail farm from which part of the profits would go to nature conservation and education. Two groups proposed ideas to stimulate the use of land, which would perhaps only fit with Rewilding Europeâs vision for the area if these activities were outside of a core wilderness area. One of these groups launched the idea for an organization that could bring conservation volunteers from all over the world to Western Iberia to help maintain the agricultural production on some of the terraces. Another group proposed a company that mediates between local communities and businesses new to the area to smoothen the purchase of land. A final business model introduced the concept of small self-sustaining office units in the landscape to rent to people who would like work in a sustainable office with a great view for inspiration. During a âmarket presentationâ, which was open to the public, students shared their visions and business models with local stakeholders and interested community members (Fig. 10.3). One of the IP students arranged during the IP her return to the region to conduct a MSc thesis research project on the use of social learning to increase levels of local involvement (Leuvenink 2013). Another MSc student helped organize the IP as an internship assignment and stayed in the region after the IP to conduct an analysis of the relation between Rewilding Europe, the Portuguese conservation partner ATN, and the local population (Walet 2014)."
320,44,0.194,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"adapt to the impacts of climate change. There is still a lack of transfer from existing scientific knowledge into conservation strategies and measures. Especially, the social effects of climate change and their impact on conservation management are not well addressed, even though they frame its decision context (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). Most of the available concepts and guidelines for the adaptation of conservation management are lacking connection to local strategies and actions. There is an urgent need for more science-practice partnerships to identify strategies that are robust to uncertainty deriving from climate projections and their ecological consequences. In addition, easy applicable tools are needed that provide no-regret options for adaptation, based on available scientific information. The adaptation of conservation management is a huge task and has to overcome multiple challenges on local level: â¢ The lack of resources: local conservation management is chronically scarce of resources like budget and manpower. New challenges like climate change are therefore hard to tackle. â¢ The lack of expertise in adaptation issues: on a local level there might be several experts trained to identifying effects of climate change, but only few are trained in adaptation issues. â¢ The lack of guidance to find suitable data and methods: in the last years an overwhelming amount of data and information on climate change and its effects has become available. A plethora of approaches and data has been published making it hard to identify relevant information and useful methods. â¢ The lack of suitable monitoring methods: signals of local climate change and its effects are hard to distinguish from the noise of natural dynamics. Robust methods helping to disentangle the web of pressures like land use and climate change are still rare. â¢ The lack of management methods: conservation experts in the field need simple, applicable tools and guidance for decision support in everyday management of conservation sites. They need methods to identify climate change related conflicts, to identify robust adaptation strategies, to choose suitable management measures, and to prioritise action. â¢ The lack of tools for communication and awareness raising: effective adaptation of conservation management needs to build public, as well as political, support for local adaptation activities. Tools for communication and participation are needed to foster environmental education, to illustrate effects of climate change, to show the relevance of adaptation measures, to guide autonomous adaptation of other land users, and to include stakeholders and the wider public in the adaptation process. Despite the existing gaps and challenges, local conservation management cannot hesitate to take action and must proceed in the face of considerable uncertainty (Conroy et al. 2011)."
222,274,0.194,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"were identified through interviews and stakeholder workshops involving government officials, local project partners, experts (e.g. academics) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Stakeholders were identified by way of an extensive mapping process (principally based on a snowball approach (Reed et al. 2009)). Additional stakeholders were identified at the more localised level (i.e. in the project case study areas in the Khulna and Barisal divisions). This process was bolstered through enhanced engagement with a small number of key stakeholders whose interests aligned most closely with the project from the perspective of use and uptake, data provision and cross-sectoral relevance. It became clear that for the mutual benefit of both the project and a small number of these key stakeholders, a more formal relationship would be preferable, and this resulted in the Water Resources Planning Organisation (WARPO) becoming a formal project partner and the establishment of a strategic alliance with the General Economics Division of the Planning Commission of the Government of Bangladesh. Representatives from round 60 institutions were actively involved in the engagement between the project and relevant institutions across multiple scales in Bangladesh. Initially, this engagement primarily took the form of formal one-to-one interviews and latterly through more widely attended workshops.1 The range of stakeholders who were contacted by project partners and who chose to participate included the following: â¢ National government officials in a range of Ministries, the portfolios of which relate to ecosystem services and human well-being (e.g. Planning Commission; Ministry of Agriculture, WARPO) â¢ Relevant non- and inter-governmental organisations at the international level (e.g. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), International Organisation for Migration, Global Water Partnership, CARE) â¢ UN organisations, multi- and bi-lateral donor agencies (e.g. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Health Organisation (WHO), World Food Programme (WFP), World Bank, Asian Development Bank)"
73,232,0.194,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,This study utilized a âquestionnaire surveyâ followed up with âinterviewsâ to elicit data from the stakeholders about their resource uses. The stakeholders in this study were restricted to the community stakeholders living along the river bank villages. Systematic consultation of representative stakeholders required us to develop a methodology which will neither repeat the spatial areas nor ignore any spatial locality. The methodology designed for the selection of local community stakeholders and conducting the questionnaire survey was the six-step approach given in Fig. 9.4 (Thoradeniya 2010). The importance of this approach is the prominence given to the Governmentâs local administrative mechanism.

For instance, service-level agreements need to be in place between the CMA and the regional and national offices so that the services to be supplied by the DWS and/or CMA need to be well defined and stipulated.14 Effective management of stakeholder relations is another important component of CMAs, and this is the fifth practice identified by the authors. We also observed this practice when interviewing the representatives of the FGG Elbe. For the FGG Elbe, stakeholder relations are not only an important communication endeavour (e.g. keeping stakeholders abreast of what is happening in the river basin and flood warning) but also necessary in the daily functions like river health monitoring.15 We argue that without good stakeholder relations, decentralisation cannot be adequately achieved since decentralisation involves the interface (e.g. communication) between authorities and stakeholders at grassroots level. In this regard, both established CMAs have relatively close and remarkably good relationships with stakeholders. These relationships, as with any relationship, had to be built from the onset. For instance, initially, stakeholders were reluctant to engage with the Breede-Gouritz CMA owing largely to challenging experiences with the regional/national DWS offices. For instance, some individuals in stakeholder groupings have been waiting on DWS for numerous years with regard to licencing applications.16 Because of this matter, stakeholders wanted to know whether the CMA would be any different from the way in which DWS carries out water-related activities and tasks. In other words, there is an expectation from stakeholders that the CMA will, in certain instances, do a âbetter jobâ than the DWS. The onus was on CMA staff attending the meetings to persuade the stakeholders firstly to participate in stakeholder meetings and explain the benefits of these meetings and secondly to give members the assurance that the past is the past and that the CMA would have other options at hand to assist stakeholders with their needs.17"

320,502,0.189,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"(Smit and Pilifosova 2001). Adaptation of conservation management means adjustments in management practices, decision-making processes and organisational structures (Welch 2005). Although the adaptation process should be started now, it must be planned as a long term process. It will be successful only if as many institutions and stakeholders as possible are actively involved and are willing to support it. Scientists have an important role to play in the development of adaptation strategies, but to facilitate effective implementation of adaptation actions local communities and decision-makers are essential. Expertise and data provided by research are a basis for a transparent and understandable decision-making process, but scientific results need to be translated and presented in a form that is accessible to professionals and decision-makers and local stakeholders (Welch 2005). The scientific information for local climate adaptation must be relevant for the decision at hand and tailored for the decision context. It should be authorised and trusted by the people affected, and transparent in the process of production. Meeting and addressing the needs, knowledge and language of local communities who have to implement adapted management practices is a major challenge for many scientists in climate impact research. Acknowledging this challenge, the project HABIT-CHANGE initiated a science-management approach to plan jointly for adaptation in protected areas. This kind of collaborative research has already produced beneficial results in other areas (Littell et al. 2012; Lonsdale and Goldthorpe 2012). The science-practice partnership for collaborative research proved to be invaluable for testing useful methods, the identification of applicable solutions and the enhancement of practical conservation management within HABIT-CHANGE. It was built on an intensive dialogue between an interdisciplinary panel of scientists and local management and facilitates the co-production of knowledge. In this process several barriers to the practical implementation of theoretical concepts were identified. Much data and many methods provided by science did not fit with planning reality and the decision context of protected area management. On the other hand, many management practices were lacking a foundation in solid facts and evaluation of their success was often neglected. Furthermore, it seems that much of the available knowledge and guidance on adaptation of conservation management does not reach local management. From the experience gained in the project we could see that climate change is rarely perceived and accepted as a high priority challenge on site level. There is often too little awareness that climate change is already a main driver of biodiversity loss and that its significance will increase even more in the future. Usually, neither management authorities nor land users and stakeholders have enough information, knowledge or incentives to plan and negotiate necessary adaptations to climate change. The adaptive capacity of local institutions like the administrations of National Parks or Biosphere Reserves is a crucial component too. The lack of expertise, methods and tools for climate adaptation as well as limited resources prevents proper management and adaptation (Fig. 20.1). The institutional setting of protected areas influences capacity and willingness to respond to new challenges"

For IUCN, partnerships are a key driving force for successful conservation action. The socio-economic and environmental challenges confronting society today are complex and far from clear-cut. Bringing together diverse stakeholders such as governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities and indigenous peoples groups, can help to address these challenges in a comprehensive and inclusive way. The complexity of urban environments underlines the importance of multidisciplinary and multi-scale partnerships in cities. Cities represent a new class of ecosystems shaped by the dynamic interactions between ecological and social systems (CBD 2012). Urban citizens depend on ecosystems both within and beyond cities for a wide variety of goods and services (e.g. food, water, energy, climate regulation), and while cities are increasingly recognised for their role in conservation (CBD 2012), urbanisation also presents a major environmental challenge, for example by driving habitat conversion (McDonald et al. 2013). Nature offers great untapped potential for improving the quality of life of urban citizens and finding solutions to challenges such as rising temperatures (the urban heat island effect) or flooding (CBD 2012). The challenge lies in developing and adopting urban planning and management approaches that ensure the delivery of regulating, provisioning, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services, while also promoting the sustainable use of resources. Ideally, stakeholders from different policy areas and sectors should come together to develop holistic approaches to managing natural capital â the worldâs stocks of natural assets which includes geology, soil, air, water and all living things. In reality however, collaboration between sectors and stakeholders is often hindered by a lack of exchange and cooperation, presenting a barrier to effective policymaking (Science for Environment Policy 2016) and the implementation of successful conservation initiatives. Multidisciplinary and cross-cutting concepts such as NBS have the potential to facilitate cooperation between sectors and contribute to a more holistic approach to tackling socio-economic and environmental challenges. From IUCNs perspective, NBS are interventions which use nature, and the ecosystem services they provide, to address societal challenges such as climate change. Well-functioning ecosystems that deliver services needed by society are at the core of these types of solutions, which include, for instance, the creation or restoration of large ecosystems; investing in natural infrastructure and watershed management for water, food and energy security and climate change adaptation; ecosystem-based mitigation oriented solutions, such as the conservation and sustainable management of forests; and using ecologically engineered solutions, such as intertidal habitats or oyster reefs to protect shorelines and reduce sea-level rise impact and coastal inundation. The aim of this chapter is to profile a broad range of partnerships led by the private sector, local communities and local/regional governments, which have restored, conserved and managed ecosystems to the benefit of people and the environment. The following sections include reflections on key outcomes and lessons that can be"

In conclusion, neutrino masses are believed to be small because neutrinos are Majorana particles with masses inversely proportional to the large scale M of energy where L non-conservation is induced. This corresponds to an important enlargement of the original minimal SM, where no R was included and L conservation was imposed by hand (but this ansatz would be totally unsatisfactory because L conservation is true âaccidentallyâ only at the renormalizable level, but is violated by non-renormalizable terms like the Weinberg operator and by instanton effects). Actually, L and B non-conservation are necessary if we want to explain baryogenesis and we have Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) in mind. It is interesting that the observed magnitudes of the mass-squared splittings of neutrinos are well compatible with a scale M remarkably close to the GUTpscale, where L non-conservation is indeed naturally expected. In fact, for mÄ  Âm2atm  0:05 eV (see Table 3.1) and mÄ  m2D =M with mD  v  200 GeV, we find M  1015 GeV which indeed is an impressive indication for MGUT .

Conservation units normally consist of vital areas. That means, ecosystems that play a vital role for the environmental functioning. Some of them are totally untouched; others have human uses more heavily regulated. It is not an easy task to monitor a conservation unit. It commonly means thousands of hectares of land and water to monitor and patrol.

233,483,0.172,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Similar prioritizations for different taxa are also quite likely to produce different outcomes. Conservation is always driven by value judgments (Vane-Wright and Coppock 2009), and there is even a risk of purposefully setting goals in a manner that produces desired spatial outcomes. Since there necessarily are multiple potentially relevant objectives, a conservative, precautionary strategy would be to assess several of them and focus on areas where most priorities are in concordance, and consider as unimportant only the areas where no high priorities occur. However, in practice different types of conservation actions could be necessary to address the different objectives, and therefore the conflicts may be more apparent than real. For instance, regions with particularly low phylogenetic diversity may also be of conservation concern as they can represent areas of active diversification (Forest et al. 2007), but they might require different type of conservation from âmuseumâ areas with relict species, as these areas and species in them might be threatened by very different processes. Another open and closely related question is at what spatial scales should we operate when measuring and prioritizing evolutionary history? In our case the assumption was that phylogenetic diversity measured as the equivalent number of Raoâs quadratic entropy of the local community was the relevant unit, but especially when assessing the diversity across the study region, the delineation of the study region will have an impact on priorities as described above, but also through âpruningâ of the phylogenetic tree: A specific region will cover parts of a full phylogeny, and regional scale prioritization with such a partial tree may prioritize areas different from a global prioritization with a full tree. Considering the amount of literature on conservation of evolutionary history in general, it is surprising how rarely it is considered in systematic conservation planning applications. Phylogenetic data are increasing and the modern computational prioritization tools are better able to account for such data even at broad scales and for large numbers of species. These developments facilitate the inclusion of phylogenetic diversity into conservation planning. We hope that it will become a routine part of spatial conservation prioritization procedures, and that the message will also better reach the broader public through active communication.

An important implication of chiral anomalies together with the topological properties of the vacuum in non-Abelian gauge theories is that the conservation of the charges associated with baryon (B) and lepton (L) numbers is broken by the anomaly [336], so that B and L conservation are actually violated in the standard electroweak theory (but B L remains conserved). B and L are conserved to all orders in the perturbative expansion, but the violation occurs via nonperturbative instanton effects [87] [The amplitude is proportional to the typical non-perturbative factor exp. c=g2 /, with c a constant and g the SU.2/ gauge coupling.] The corresponding effect is totally negligible at zero temperature T, but becomes relevant at temperatures close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, precisely at T  O.TeV/. The non-conservation of B C L and the conservation of B L near the weak scale plays a role in the theory of baryogenesis that aims quantitatively at explaining the observed matterâantimatter asymmetry in the Universe (for reviews and references, see, for example, [115])."
282,56,0.171,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"accountable. Workers in liberal democracies, for example, have the right to unionise, which strengthens their bargaining position in relation to management. In some countries, they even have the right to be represented on the company board. The position of consumers is strengthened, for example, by rules demanding companies to publish the ingredients of products. And many local communities assert their right to influence companiesâ activities by keeping a tight grip on planning permissions. But these examples also show that the main demand of stakeholder theory, namely that stakeholders have a right to participate in decision making, is not being implemented consistently. Firstly, the stakeholder groups mentioned by Freeman are granted access to very different accountability mechanisms. Only very few apart from shareholders and managers are recognised to have a direct right to âdetermine the future direction of the companyâ by being represented on the board. In Germany, Austria and the Scandinavian countries, for example, only employees have a right to representation.15 In countries that are closer to the Anglo-American tradition, not even employee representation is recognised. Secondly, some stakeholder groups are not granted access to any accountability mechanisms at all. Take the employees of a competitor for instance. They are clearly stakeholders because the companyâs policies affect the position of its competitors, which in turn influences the prospects of the competitorsâ employees. Despite their status as stakeholders, their right to hold the company to account is not recognised in any major legal system. Similarly, the rights of communities that donât live in the immediate neighbourhood of a company are not usually protected by law. Different stakeholder groups are thus treated differently in both practice and discourse. Stakeholder theory claims that institutions should be accountable to all those who are influenced by a company or can influence it. This logic contains two options for differentiating between stakeholders: by the degree of influence they wield over the company or by the degree to which they are influenced by it. Neither version, however, provides a sufficient explanation for why stakeholders should get access to different kinds of accountability mechanisms. The first option was later pursued, for example, by the original proponents of stakeholder theory. Edward Freeman and David Reed propose to recognise not only âstakeholders in the wider senseâ as defined earlier but also âstakeholders in the narrow senseâ. The latter are defined as âAny identifiable group or individual on which the organization is dependent for its survivalâ (Freeman and Reed, 1983, p. 91).16 This distinction based on the power of stakeholders generates results that are practically less problematic and provide a better match to current practice than the original formulation. But the match is not perfect. Even using the narrow definition, competitors must be recognised as stakeholders and the demand that they should have a right to hold an organisation"

72,244,0.168,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"SMG regarded citizen engagement as one of the core strategies driving social innovation across Seoul. Citizen engagement was used as a mechanism that empowered Seoul citizens to express what they needed, explore how these needs could be met and decide what could be done in response. In this way, SMG was able to understand citizensâ needs better, collect unexpected but working solutions, and create opportunities to resolve conflicting issues among different stakeholders (Y. Kim, 2013; T. Kim, 2013). One way of conceptualising citizen engagement is to use the Spectrum of Public Participation developed by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2, 2014). This sets out different public participation goals (from the perspective of the state) in order of increasing level of public impact, from âinformâ to âconsultâ, âinvolveâ, âcollaborateâ and finally, âempowerâ. Prior to Mayor Parkâs administration, SMG used citizen engagement activities such as public hearings and citizen surveys to implement new city policies. However, these programmes were limited to the âinformingâ and âconsultingâ types of engagement. In contrast, many new tools and programmes developed and operated by SMG under Mayor Parkâs leadership specifically centred around âinvolvingâ, âcollaborating withâ and âempoweringâ citizens in decision-making activities. The next section will explore these tools and programmes together with the principles underpinning SMGâs citizen engagement strategy."

282,16,0.168,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"The Political Declaration of the WSSD in Johannesburg, which was so instrumental in promoting the concept of partnership by including it as an official, âtype IIâ, outcome of the summit, contains no more than the following: We recognize that sustainable development requires a long-term perspective and broad-based participation in policy formulation, decision-making and implementation at all levels. As social partners, we will continue to work for stable partnerships with all major groups, respecting the independent, important roles of each of them. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002a, Â§ 26) The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation that was adopted along with the political declaration is slightly more detailed in that it specifies the involvement of âmajor groupsâ in partnerships. At the same time, it constricts the definition to include only cooperative arrangements focusing on policy implementation (rather than policy definition, for example) in the area of sustainable development. [T]he implementation should involve all relevant actors through partnerships, especially between Governments of the North and South, on the one hand, and between Governments and major groups, on the other, to achieve the widely shared goals of sustainable development. As reflected in the Monterrey Consensus, such partnerships are key to pursuing sustainable development in a globalizing world. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002b, Â§ 3) This definition of partnerships and the subsequent work of the UN are, however, based on a more detailed description of criteria for partnerships. The criteria were developed in the run-up to WSSD and endorsed in the decision of the eleventh meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Like the definition proposed here, they recognise partnerships as voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiatives. But they only focus on initiatives designed to contribute to the implementation of internationally agreed development goals and include a range of normative criteria, such as that partnerships should pursue an integrated approach to sustainable development, display a sectoral and geographical balance and be designed in a transparent and accountable manner.5 The WSSDâs focus on cooperation in order to achieve a public policy goal is echoed in the political science literature, for example, in BÃ¶rzel and Risse, who focus on partnerships that transcend national borders: Transnational PPPs [public-private partnerships] would then be institutionalized cooperative relationships between public actors (both governments"
284,118,0.165,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"and Natural Resources, the objective of which is to âassociate the conservation of natural capital with economic and social developmentâ (OCDE, 2013: 40). The dual process involved in the recognition of indigenous knowledge has thus been made part of the development pattern for agricultural and environmental policies. In this dual ministerial context, the Mexican Government undertook the task of integrating the participation of the native and peasant population into its agricultural policy and also into its political agenda, thereby institutionalizing national environmental policy. The Ministry of the Environment has conï¬rmed that âthe native populations that maintain a very close link with natural resources and biodiversity actively support sustainable development through on-site conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats, and the maintenance and recuperation of viable populations of species in their natural surroundingsâ.15 In 1997 the Ministry of the Environment initiated the Conservation and Restoration Programme of soils. In 1998 it launched the National Reforestation Programme and other programmes that sought to combine economic and social development with environmental conservation. The objective was to devote economic resources to National Protected Areas and to the restoration of regions identiï¬ed as priorities from an environmental perspective. The main tools that the government has used have always been aimed at the conservation of biodiversity and of forests, in accordance with the National Strategy for Biodiversity (2000), complemented by the Mexican Strategy for the Conservation of Plants (which has existed since 2008 and was revised in 2012) and subsequently enhanced by the National Strategy combating invasive species. Major programmes within this framework have been speciï¬cally dedicated to native and peasant populations. A twist was introduced, however, when the Ministry of the Environment developed its Regional Sustainable Development Programme (Programa de Desarrollo Regional Sustentable (PRODERS)) in an attempt to link the environmentalist vision to a developmentalist one. The programme was presented as a comprehensive initiative by means of which SEMARNAT contributed to the support of sustainable development in poor rural regions. These regions often include native and peasant populations who live where the major biological and environmental riches are located, far from the rural nodes. The management of this programme was supposed to be decentralized and participative, based on a long-term vision (Toledo and Bartra, 2000)."

141,19,0.164,Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Foundations â A Conceptual Model and Some Derivations: The AMADEOS Legacy,"We decided to select the following deï¬nition of Jamishidi as the starting point of our work [10]. System-of-Systems (SoS): An SoS is an integration of a ï¬nite number of constituent systems (CS) which are independent and operable, and which are networked together for a period of time to achieve a certain higher goal. We consider the phrase that are networked together for a period of time an important part of this deï¬nition, since it denotes that a static scope of an SoS may not exist and the boundary between an SoS and its environment can be dynamic. Dahmann and Baldwin have introduced the following four categories of SoSs [11]: Directed SoS: An SoS with a central managed purpose and central ownership of all CSs. An example would be the set of control systems in an unmanned rocket. Acknowledged SoS: Independent ownership of the CSs, but cooperative agreements among the owners to an aligned purpose. Collaborative SoS: Voluntary interactions of independent CSs to achieve a goal that is beneï¬cial to the individual CS. Virtual SoS: Lack of central purpose and central alignment. While a directed SoS, e.g., the CSs in an automobile that are under strict central management and ownership of a car company, comes close to a homogenous system, the other extreme, a virtual CS, lacks the elements of homogeneity and is formed by heterogeneous subsystems belonging to very different organizations. We call an interface of a CS where the services of a CS are offered to other CSs a Relied Upon Interface (RUI). It is âârelied uponââ with respect to the SoS, since the service of the SoS as a whole relies on the services provided by the respective CSs across the RUIs. Relied upon Interface (RUI): An interface of a CS where the services of the CS are offered to other CSs."
