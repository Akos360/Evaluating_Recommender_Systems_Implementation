We will give a brief description of what is happening. Later we will see the mathematical model that describes both spin and polarization. Recall our quantum clock. We can ask if the hand is pointing at twelve, or we can ask if the hand is pointing at six. The information we gain from either question tells us which of the numbers 12 or 6 the hand is pointing to, but the Yes/No answers are reversed. For the polarized squares the analogous questions are asked by rotating the square by ninety degreesânot one hundred and eighty. The information we obtain is the same. The difference is that if the answer is yes, the photon passes through the filter and we can perform more measurements on it, but if the answer is no, the filter absorbs the photon, so we cannot ask it further questions. The first two experiments involved just two sheets and are telling us exactly the same thing: When we repeat a measurement, we get the same result. In both experiments we are measuring the polarization in the vertical and horizontal directions two times. In these experiments, the photons that pass through the first filter have vertical orientations. The first experiment, where the second filter also has vertical orientation, we are asking the question, âIs the photon vertically polarized?â twice and we receive the answer âYesâ twice. In the second experiment, the second question is changed to âIs the photon horizontally polarized?â and receives the answer âNo.â Both experiments give us the same information, but the negative answer for the second question in the second experiment means that the photon is absorbed and so, unlike the first experiment, it is not available for further questioning. In the third experiment, the filter that has been rotated through fortyfive degrees is now measuring the polarization at angles of 45Â° and 135Â°. We"

Similar requirements are also useful in the single-tag cases described below to ensure a small Q2 for the untagged photon. 22.1.4 Single-tag measurements When one of the scattered electrons is detected, we refer to these two-photon processes as single-tag modes. In the single-tag process, we can probe the structure of the real photon or a hadron with a high-Q2 photon; this process is very useful for studies of hadron and QCD physics such as meson transition form factors (Brodsky and Lepage, 1981). The Q2 of the virtual photon is determined by measuring the scattering angle and energy of the recoil electron with the following Lorentz-invariant formula: Q2 = 4Eb E â² sin2 ,"

Since the photon couples directly to the electric charge of quarks, we can study hadron structures and QCD physics, eï¬ectively, in hadron production induced by two-photon collisions. The even C-parity of the twophoton system is complementary with the odd C-parity in e+ eâ collisions. In an e+ eâ collider, a virtual photon is emitted from each lepton; a collision of these photons produces final-state particles as shown in Figure 22.1.1. The two-photon center-of-mass (CM) energy, W , which is the same as the invariant mass of the final-state system, is continuously distributed between zero and just below the e+ eâ CM energy. For practical purposes, the usable range is between a few 100 MeV and â¼ 4.5 GeV. The lower side is limited by experimental trigger conditions and the upper by the luminosity and backgrounds from e+ eâ annihilation events."
249,215,0.276,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"For one thing, â is presumably grounded upon a sort of our epistemic capacity to put symbols in parallel (inside and outside sequents) as discussed above. The epistemic capacity may be so fundamental that it plays fundamental rÃ´les in symbolic reasoning as well as many other cognitive practices; this will lead to a sort of epistemic account of admissibility of â in the principle of categorical harmony. Another âinformationalâ account of it seems possible as well. There are three fundamental questions: What propositions hold? Why do they hold? How do they hold? The first one is about truth and falsity, the second one about proofs, and the last one about the mechanisms of proofs. An answer to the last question must presumably include an account of the way how resources or assumptions for inference are used in proofs, or how relevant inferential information is used in proofs. And â may be seen as a means to address that particular part of the third question. This is the informational account, which has some affinities with the view of linear logic as the logic of resources. Yet another âphysicalâ account may be came up with. In recent developments of categorical quantum mechanics by Abramsky and Coecke (see Abramsky [1] and references therein), the capacities to put things in parallel as well as in sequence play vital rÃ´les in their so-called graphical calculus for quantum mechanics and computation, where parallel composition represents the composition of quantum systems (resp. processes), i.e., the tensor product of Hilbert spaces (resp. morphisms), which is crucial in quantum phenomena involving entanglement, such as the EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen paradox and the violation of the Bell inequality. In general, â lacks diagonals and projections, unlike cartesian Ã, and this corresponds to the No-Cloning and No-Deleting theorems in quantum computation stating that quantum information can neither be copied nor deleted (note that diagonals â : X â X â X copy information X , and projections p : X â Y â X delete information Y ). On the other hand, classical information can be copied and deleted as you like. So, the monoidal feature of â witnesses a crucial border between classical and quantum information. To account for such quantum features of the microscopic world, we do need â in the logic of quantum mechanics, and this would justify to add â to primitive vocabularies. The physical account seems relevant to the well-known question âIs logic empirical?â, which was originally posed in the context of quantum logic, and has been discussed by Quine, Putnam, Dummett, and actually Kripke (see Stairs [24]). The need of multiplicative â in the âtrueâ logic of quantum mechanics is quite a recent issue which has not been addressed in the philosophy community yet, and this may have some consequences to both the traditional question âIs logic empirical?â and the present question âWhy are substructural logical constants are so special?â, as partly argued above. A more detailed analysis of these issues will be given somewhere else. Sambin et al. [19] present a novel method to introduce logical constants by what they call the reflection principle and definitional equalities, some of which are as follows: â¢ Ï â¨ Ï â¢ Î¾ iff Ï â¢ Î¾ and Ï â¢ Î¾ . â¢ Ï, Ï â¢ Î¾ iff Ï â Ï â¢ Î¾ . â¢ Î â¢ Ï â Ï iff Î â¢ (Ï â¢ Ï)."
305,249,0.263,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"Feynman thought that one of the main applications of quantum computers would be to simulate quantum systems. Using quantum computers to study chemistry that belongs to the quantum world is a natural idea that has great potential. There are a number of areas where it is hoped that quantum computing will make important contributions. One of these is to understand how an enzyme, nitrogenase, used to make fertilizers actually works. The current method of producing fertilizers releases a significant amount of greenhouse gases and consumes considerable energy. Quantum computers could play a major role in understanding this and other catalytic reactions. There is a group at the University of Chicago that is looking into photosynthesis. The transfer of sunlight to chemical energy is a process that happens quickly and very efficiently. It is a quantum mechanical process. The long-term goal is to understand this process and then use it in photovoltaic cells. Superconductivity and magnetism are quantum mechanical phenomena. Quantum computers may help us understand them better. One goal is to develop superconductors that donât need to be cooled to near absolute zero. The actual construction of quantum computers is in its infancy, but even with a few qubits it is possible to begin studying chemistry. IBM recently simulated the molecule beryllium hydride (BeH2) on a seven-qubit quantum processor. This is a relatively small molecule with just three atoms. The simulation does not use the approximations that are used in the classical computational approach. However, since IBMâs processor uses just a few qubits, it is possible to simulate the quantum processor using a classical computer. Consequently, everything that can be done on this quantum processor can be done classically. However, as processors incorporate more qubits we get to the point where it is no longer possible to simulate them classically. We will soon be entering a new era when quantum simulations are beyond the power of any classical computer. Now that we have seen some of the possible applications, we will briefly survey some of the ways that are being used to build quantum computers.

213,13,0.252,Collider Physics Within The Standard Model : a Primer,"a field with suitable (depending on the particle spin) transformation properties under the Lorentz group (the relativistic spacetime coordinate transformations). It is remarkable that the description of all these particle interactions is based on a common principle: âgaugeâ invariance. A âgaugeâ symmetry is invariance under transformations that rotate the basic internal degrees of freedom, but with rotation angles that depend on the spacetime point. At the classical level, gauge invariance is a property of the Maxwell equations of electrodynamics, and it is in this context that the notion and the name of gauge invariance were introduced. The prototype of all quantum gauge field theories, with a single gauged charge, is quantum electrodynamics (QED), developed in the years from 1926 until about 1950, which is indeed the quantum version of Maxwellâs theory. Theories with gauge symmetry in four spacetime dimensions are renormalizable and are completely determined given the symmetry group and the representations of the interacting fields. The whole set of strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions is described by a gauge theory with 12 gauged non-commuting charges. This is called the âStandard Modelâ of particle interactions (SM). Actually, only a subgroup of the SM symmetry is directly reflected in the spectrum of physical states. A part of the electroweak symmetry is hidden by the Higgs mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry. The theory of general relativity is a classical description of gravity (in the sense that it is non-quantum mechanical). It goes beyond the static approximation described by Newtonâs law and includes dynamical phenomena like, for example, gravitational waves. The problem of formulating a quantum theory of gravitational interactions is one of the central challenges of contemporary theoretical physics. But quantum effects in gravity only become important for energy concentrations in spacetime which are not in practice accessible to experimentation in the laboratory. Thus the search for the correct theory can only be done by a purely speculative approach. All attempts at a description of quantum gravity in terms of a well defined and computable local field theory along similar lines to those used for the SM have so far failed to lead to a satisfactory framework. Rather, at present, the most complete and plausible description of quantum gravity is a theory formulated in terms of non-pointlike basic objects, the so-called âstringsâ, extended over much shorter distances than those experimentally accessible and which live in a spacetime with 10 or 11 dimensions. The additional dimensions beyond the familiar 4 are, typically, compactified, which means that they are curled up with a curvature radius of the order of the string dimensions. Present string theory is an all-comprehensive framework that suggests a unified description of all interactions including gravity, in which the SM would be only a low energy or large distance approximation. A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, implies that, when studying particles with spatial dimensions of order Âx or interactions taking place at distances of order Âx, one needs as a probe a beam of particles (typically produced by an accelerator) with impulse p & â=Âx, where â is the reduced Planck constant (â D h=2).

For example, if the beta functions at the collision point are comparable or smaller than the bunch length, the luminosity is lower than that predicted by (1.2). This is referred to as the âhourglass effectâ. In addition, at high current the focusing force of the opposing beam may significantly change the single-particle optics. As a result, the beta functions at the interaction point either increase or decrease (âdynamic beta functionâ), and the luminosity changes accordingly. The parameter describing the photon-beam quality of a synchrotronradiation light source is the spectral brightness B, which refers to the photon flux in the six-dimensional phase space.

After looking at algorithms, we switch gears and briefly look at how quantum computation can be used to simulate quantum processes. Chemistry, at its most basic level, is quantum mechanical. Classical computational chemistry works by taking quantum mechanical equations and simulating them using classical computers. These simulations are approximations and ignore the fine details. This works well in many cases, but in some cases it doesnât. In these cases you need the fine details, and quantum computers should be able to give them. This chapter also briefly looks at building actual machines. This is a very fast-growing area. The first machines are being offered for sale. There is even one machine available on the cloud that everyone can use for free. It looks likely that we will soon enter the age of quantum supremacy. (We explain what this means.)

It includes reversible as well as irreversible processes, and is prima facie inconsistent. As already von Neumann [552, 554] and later Everett [30, 206, 545] noted, there cannot be any irreversible measurement process nested in a ubiquitous uniformly reversible evolution of the quantum state. Both von Neumann and Everett called the former, irreversible, discontinuous change the âprocess 1â; and the latter, reversible, continuous, deterministic change the âprocess 2,â respectively. Stated differently, there cannot exist any irreversible many-to-one measurement scenario (other than pragmatic fappness) in a reversible one-to-one environment. Hence, if one wants to maintain irreversible measurements, then (at least within the quantum formalism) one is faced with the following dilemma: either quantum mechanics must be augmented with some irreversible, many-to-one state evolution, thereby spoiling the ubiquitous, universal reversible one-to-one state evolution; or the assumption of the co-existence of a ubiquitous, uniform reversible one-to-one state evolution on the one hand with some irreversible many-to-one âwave function collapse,â (by another wording, âreduction of the state vectorâ) throughout measurement on the other hand, yields a complete contradiction. How is such a situation handled in other areas? Every system of logic which is self-contradictory (inconsistent) â such that a proposition as well as its negation is postulated; or can be derived from the postulates â in particular, in a formal axiomatic system, is detrimental and disastrous. Because by the principle of explosion (Latin: ex falso quodlibet) any invocation of a statement as well as of its negation yields every proposition true. This can be motivated by supposing that both âPâ as well as ânot Pâ are true. Then the proposition âP or anythingâ is true (because at least âPâ is true). Now suppose that also ânot Pâ holds. But then, in order for âP or anythingâ to be true, âanythingâ needs to be true. However, if anything is derivable, then such a system lacks any descriptive or predictive capacity. In this Â© The Author(s) 2018 K.

217,478,0.223,Finite Difference Computing With Pdes : a Modern Software Approach,"2.14 Applications of Wave Equations This section presents a range of wave equation models for different physical phenomena. Although many wave motion problems in physics can be modeled by the standard linear wave equation, or a similar formulation with a system of first-order equations, there are some exceptions. Perhaps the most important is water waves: these are modeled by the Laplace equation with time-dependent boundary conditions at the water surface (long water waves, however, can be approximated by a standard wave equation, see Sect. 2.14.7). Quantum mechanical waves constitute another example where the waves are governed by the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, i.e., not by a standard wave equation. Many wave phenomena also need to take nonlinear effects into account when the wave amplitude is significant. Shock waves in the air is a primary example. The derivations in the following are very brief.

For our purposes, the important fact is that the energy levels of the Cooper pairs in a superconducting loop that contains a Josephson junction are discrete and can be used to encode qubits. IBM uses superconducting qubits in its quantum computers. In 2016, IBM introduced a five-qubit processor that they have made available to everyone for free on the cloud. Anyone can design their own quantum circuit, as long as it uses five or fewer qubits, and run it on this computer. IBMâs aim is to introduce quantum computing to a wide audienceâcircuits for superdense coding, for Bellâs inequality, and a model of the hydrogen atom have all been run on this machine. A primitive version of Battleships has also been run, giving the coder the claim of constructing the first quantum computer multiplayer game. At the end of 2017, IBM connected a twenty-qubit computer to the cloud. This time it is not for education, but it is a commercial venture where companies can buy access. Google is working on its quantum computer. It also uses superconducting qubits. Google is expected to announce in the near future that it has a computer that uses 72 qubits. What is special about this number? Classical computers can simulate quantum computers if the quantum computer doesnât have too many qubits, but as the number of qubits increases we reach the point where that is no longer possible. Google is expected to announce that it has reached or exceeded this number, giving them the right to claim quantum supremacyâthe first time an algorithm has been run on a quantum computer that is impossible to run, or simulate, on a classical computer. IBM, however, is not giving up without a fight. Its team, using some innovative ideas, has recently found a way to simulate a 56-qubit system classically, increasing the lower bound on the number of qubits needed for quantum supremacy. As work continues on building quantum computers, we are likely to see spinoffs into other areas. Qubits, however we encode them, are sensitive to interactions with their surroundings. As we understand these interactions better we will be able to build better shields to protect our qubits, but we will also be able to design ways our qubits can measure their surroundings. ** Brian David Josephson received the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on how Cooper pairs can flow through a Josephson junction by quantum tunneling."
26,31,0.221,Cognitive Supervision for Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Laser Surgery,"2.1 Physical Properties of Light Our understanding of the nature of light is based on the fact that it exhibits properties of both electromagnetic (EM) waves and elementary particles, this characteristic is known as the wave-particle duality [1]. First, we consider the description of light as EM waves; the terms light and EM radiation are used interchangeably throughout this dissertation. Light can be regarded as the perturbation produced by the interplay of mutually related electric and magnetic fields. Each pair of electric/magnetic fields is characterized by a common wavelength Î» and oscillate perpendicular with each other and at right angle to the direction of propagation, as shown in Fig. 2.1. In general, EM radiation is classified according to the range of wavelengths it contains. The EM spectrum covers all the possible wavelengths of EM radiation: a limited interval is shown in Fig. 2.2, ranging from longer wavelengths (Microwaves) to shorter (XRays). A fundamental physical property of EM waves is the frequency Î½, which relates to the wavelength through the relation c = Î½ Â· Î», where c is the speed of EM waves in vacuum. The classic picture of light as EM waves can be revisited in the perspective of the quantum theory. In its simplest form, the theory describes light as the"

The important observation in annealing is that the energy required to push the ball bearing up the hill and let it drop into valley B is much less than the energy needed to push the ball bearing up from B and let it drop into A. So, we shake the bucket with an energy level between these two values. The ball can move from A to B, but it cannot move back. After a while of shaking at this level, it will end up either at the bottom of A or B. But shaking at this level can send the ball from C to B. The next step is to shake it again, but less energetically, with enough energy to get it up the peak from B to C, but not enough to let it get back from C to B. In practice, you start shaking and gradually reduce the energy. This corresponds to gradually cooling your piece of metal in traditional annealing. The result is that the ball bearing ends up at the lowest point. You have found the absolute minimum of the function. Quantum annealing adds quantum tunneling. This is a quantum effect where the ball bearing can just appear on the other side of a hill. Instead of going over, it can go through. Instead of reducing the heights of hills the ball can climb, you reduce the length of the tunnels it can tunnel through. D-Wave has produced a number of commercially available computers that use quantum annealing for optimization problems. Initially, they were met with some skepticism about whether the computers actually used quantum tunneling, but now it is generally agreed that they do. There is still some question of whether the computers are faster than classical ones, but people are buying. Volkswagen, Google, and Lockheed Martin, among others, have all bought D-Wave machines. After this brief look at hardware, we turn to deeper questions. What does quantum computation tell us about us, the universe, and what computation is at its most fundamental level? Quantum Supremacy and Parallel Universes There are 8 possible three-bit combinations: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. The number 8 comes from 2 3 . There are two choices for the first bit, two for the second and two for the third, and we multiply these three 2s together.

65,156,0.211,Handbook of Ocean Wave Energy,"couplings between wave components, but in this case they are between sets of three wave components that cause energy transfer via non-linear interactions. When the waves are dispersive these interactions cannot be created, which is why they only occur in very shallow water. The effect of triad wave-wave interactions is to generate a second peak in the wave spectrum at twice the frequency of the original spectrum, which is bound to the main frequency peak in the sense that it travels with the same phase velocity. Unfortunately, currently third generation wave models are unable to correctly model these bound waves, and the triad wave-wave interaction source term is estimated based on the wave spectrum and water depth; however, these source terms have been found to be reasonable approximations in most cases. â¢ The ï¬nal source term typically included in wave models is the depth-induced wave breaking (surf-breaking) source term. This source term typically assumes that a ï¬xed proportion of the energy in any wave is lost when it breaks. Thus it is necessary to make an estimate on the proportion of waves that break at any particular water depth for any particular wave spectrum. This may be done by making some assumptions about the distribution of wave heights and the relative water depth in which these waves will break. Perhaps surprisingly, laboratory observations suggest that the spectral shape is not affected by wave breaking and so the energy removed due to wave breaking, and thus the strength of the depth-induced wave breaking source term, is typically assumed to be proportional to the wave energy spectrum, with the coefï¬cient of proportionality dependent on the proportion of breaking waves."

Among them, the following fact should be emphasised: â¢ Definitional equalities do not always imply adjointness, partly due to what they call the âvisibilityâ condition, which requires us to restrict context formulae in sequent-style rules of inference (categorically, this amounts to restricting so-called Frobenius reciprocity conditions). â For example, implication is not necessarily a right adjoint of conjunction in the system of âbasic logicâ derived via their guiding principles. This deviation from adjointness actually seems to be inevitable for Sambin et al., because they want to include Birkhoff-von Neumannâs quantum logic with some concept of implication as a structural extension of their basic logic; however, quantum implication (if any) cannot be a right adjoint of conjunction, due to the nondistributive nature of it, which is essential in Birkhoff-von Neumannâs quantum logic to account for superposition states in quantum systems. In contrast, categorical harmony cannot allow for any sort of non-adjoint implication. Is this a good feature or not? It depends on whether such implication counts as genuine implication, and so on our very conception of logical constants. The categorical logicianâs answer would be no: for example, Abramsky [1] asserts that Birkhoff-von Neumannâs quantum logic is considered to be ânon-logicâ because it does not have any adequate concept of implication (on the other hand, categorical quantum logic is said to be âhyper-logicâ). Finally, it should be noted that Schroeder-Heister [21] compares the framework of Sambin et al. [19] with his framework of definitional reflection, and that Bonnay and Simmenauer [4] proposes to exploit the idea of Sambin et al. [19] in order to remedy the aforementioned defect (the âblonkâ problem) of DoÅ¡enâs double-line approach in [8, 9]."

How Do You Entangle Qubits? This book is about the mathematics that underlies quantum computing. It is not about how to physically create a quantum computer. We are not going to spend much time on the details of physical experiments, but the question of how physicists create entangled particles is such an important one that we will briefly address it. We can represent entangled qubits by either entangled photons or electrons. Though we often say the particles are entangled, what we really mean is that the vector describing their states, a tensor in ï2 â ï2 , is entangled. The actual particles are separate and, as we have just noted, can be very far apart. That said, the question remains: How do you go about creating a pair of particles whose state vector is entangled? First, we look at how physical experiments create entangled particles. Then we look at how quantum gates create entangled qubits. The most commonly used method at this time involves photons. The process is called spontaneous parametric down-conversion. A laser beam sends photons through a special crystal. Most of the photons just pass through, but some photons split into two. Energy and momentum must be conservedâthe total energy and momentum of the two resulting photons must equal the energy and momentum of the initial photon. The conservation laws guarantee that the state describing the polarization of the two photons is entangled. In the universe, electrons are often entangled. At the start of the book we described Stern and Gerlachâs experiment on silver atoms. Recall that"

Figure 3.3 shows an example of this characterisation illustrating the variation in the average omni-directional wave power around the world. As would be expected, the areas with higher average omni-directional wave power, such as the north-west coast of Europe, are also the areas with the most interest in the deployment of wave energy converters. The implicit assumption is that a wave energy converterâs power capture is proportional to the average omni-directional wave power thus a larger average omni-directional wave power equates to a larger power capture. However, whilst it may be reasonable to assume that a wave energy converter will produce more power at a site with an average omni-directional wave power of 40 kW/m compared to an alternative site with 2 kW/m, it is less clear that this will be true if the alternative site had an average omni-directional wave power of 30 kW/m. The key factor to consider is that when comparing potential sites the use of the average omni-directional wave power obscures information regarding the temporal, directional and spectral characteristics of the wave climate (see Sect. 3.2) that may be important to the average power capture. Of course, how these characteristics may affect the average power generation will vary with the WEC and so it is difï¬cult to be overly prescriptive regarding the extent of distortion that may be due to using average omni-directional wave power as a proxy for average power generation. One method to compensate for the potential distortion is to provide information on other aspects of the wave climate simultaneously with the average omni-directional wave power. Examples of this additional information could include the ratio of maximum wave power to average wave power, the average directionality coefï¬cient, the average spectral width, and/or the average energy period. Unfortunately, whilst this additional information does provide more details of the characteristics of the wave resource that may suggest the relative strengths and weaknesses of particular sites, it still does not provide a clear indication of how a WECâs power generation may differ between locations. Whilst it is frustrating that a single parameter, or even set of parameters, cannot be used to assess the suitability of a potential WEC deployment site, this is the state of the wave energy industry at the moment. The rich diversity of WEC concepts currently being developed means that there are a multiple of relationships between the wave resource and power generation. Moreover, it is possible that a particular WEC concept may be most suitable at one location, whilst another WEC concept is more suitable at another location. Thus, there may not be the complete convergence onto a single concept as in wind energy, with the three-bladed horizontal-axis turbine, due to the potentially greater diversity of wave resource characteristics compared to wind resource characteristics, which is generally successfully characterised simply by the average wind speed. Although not associated with a particular WEC concept, a useful illustration of the dangers of using the average omni-directional wave power as a proxy for power generation is in assessing the effect of water depth on the incident wave power. Off of the west coast of Scotland, the average omni-directional wave power decreases as it approaches the shore and the water depth reduces, so that in 10â20 m of water it is only typically 50 % of its offshore value. To assess the extent that this"
65,496,0.197,Handbook of Ocean Wave Energy,"To begin with, a general appreciation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the device should be made. This can in practice be done in regular waves and without any PTO loading, by making various short tests (0.5â2 min each) where the wave height is maintained constant and the wave periods are each time incremented. This should be repeated for constant wave periods and increasing wave heights, and it could for example be used to identify the resonance frequency of the structure or of the wave activated body and show the range of effect of the wave conditions. A similar approach could possibly be used to investigate the influence of different conï¬gurations, for example if the device has an adaptable geometry, weight or floating level. After the hydrodynamic behaviour, the sensitivity and relevant working range of the PTO loading adjustment system have to be assessed. In this case, the load should be increased again in batches (0.5â2 min each) for a couple of the tested wave conditions. In practice, this can be done by incrementing the load between each batch by 10 % of its full range and repeated for the smallest, one or two medium and the largest sea states. Although these tests are not crucial, they often lead to a signiï¬cant gain in time. Note that in order to maintain the same wave energy content in between regular and irregular waves, the signiï¬cant wave height (Hm0) from the irregular waves has to be divided by â2 to obtain the wave height for the regular waves, while maintaining the same wave period (T = Te). However, in the case that the response or performance of the device is mostly dependent on the wave period, it might be beneï¬cial to match the wave period in regular waves with Tp, as this is the dominant wave period in irregular waves. The actual performance assessment is based on long-crested irregular waves, having a speciï¬c wave spectral shape (e.g. JONSWAP spectrum with É£ = 3.3). Each individual IW lab test should have a length of 1000 peak wave periods (for statistical robustness), which should take about 20â30 min, depending on the scale. Moreover, in each wave condition the PTO load needs to be optimised for optimal energy production (as presented in Fig. 9.12). Ideally, an exact reproduction of the waves should be performed in between those tests. Depending on the complexity"

8,300,0.195,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","Black Body Radiation I now need to introduce another concept that has played an influential role by undermining classical physics. This idea forced Planck to postulate the quantum hypothesis initiating a radical conceptual change which culminated in the formulation of quantum theory. Arguably, there has not been anything of comparable importance discovered since. I present to you âBlack Body Radiationâ. If you place a completely empty boxâa cavityâin a heat bath of temperature T, it does not remain empty; it fills with electromagnetic radiation, whose spectral distribution, i.e. the composition of different wavelengths (radio waves, heat, light, ultraviolet light, X-rays), is described accurately by Planckâs radiation law. This spectral distribution is a function of temperature; in fact, we measure temperature of very hot and/or far and distant bodies (stars), by studying the radiation spectral distribution. Aside of the spectral distribution dependence on the temperature, the intensity of the radiation is also temperature dependent. Namely, the total radiated energy is proportional to T 4 . Or said differently, the way I prefer: the temperature is proportional to the fourth root of the radiation energy content. When the temperature just doubles, the radiation energy is increased 16 times. From daily life experience, by and large, (that is, apart from chemical and phase changes, such as melting, boiling), we are accustomed to thermal energy being approximately proportional to temperature increases; that is, 16 times the thermal energy also means 16 times the temperature. This is because heat is nothing more than the random motion of molecules and that, as their number (usually) remains constant, all energy supplied again finds itself as heat and the temperature increases proportionally: temperature is defined as a measure of the average kinetic energy per molecule. However, in the radiation fieldâalso called photon gasâthe number of âmolecules,â that is to say, the number of photons, is not at all constant: ever more and more of them are created as the temperature is increased, as I supply ever more energy. This larger number of photons, many more than were originally available, must share the newly supplied energy; therefore each photon takes only a minor portion for itself, than it would have received, had their number been constant. The temperature = average energy per photon rises more slowly than in the case of constant particle number; in consideration that a large part has just been invested in the creation of new photons. In a more careful evaluation we find the Stefanâ Boltzmann law which I introduced, the p temperature is proportional to the fourth root of energy density: T D Const:  4 E What does this have to do with our indestructible nucleons and the newly created particles? All we need is to generalize the concept of black body radiation: who says that the radiation must consist only of photons? There is no law in physics prohibiting material particles forming from radiation. In fact, relativity and quantum theory claim it outright: if E  mc2 , a particle of mass m can arise spontaneously (there are certain constraining conservation laws, but in principle this detail changes nothing). So if we increase the temperature of our box on and on, it is inevitable"

A photon can undergo pair production in the material of the detector before reaching the calorimeter. If the produced tracks are reconstructed in the tracking detectors, the corresponding clusters in the calorimeter, if any, are tagged as being produced by a charged track and the photon candidate is lost. Even if the reconstruction algorithms still ï¬nd a photon candidate, the energy resolution might be degraded, leading to a Ï 0 candidate with an incorrectly reconstructed energy or mass. â Imperfect modeling of photon shower shape. In order to discriminate electromagnetic from hadronic showers, shower shape variables such as the lateral moment,47 the number of crystals in a shower etc. are used. Showers tend to be somewhat narrower in simulation than in data, creating a small eï¬ciency diï¬erence between data and MC. â Split-oï¬s. The particle showers created by hadrons interacting with the material in the calorimeter contain a fraction of neutral hadrons. Such secondary hadrons can travel a sizable distance in the calorimeter before interacting with the material and depositing (a part of) their energy. These so-called split-oï¬s leave the signature of a calorimeter cluster without an associated track pointing to it, which is hard to distinguish from a real photon. Cluster split-oï¬s occur close to tracks, and the secondary showers usually have low energies. Detailed modeling of hadronic showers is diï¬cult, thus split-oï¬s present a further potential source of systematic diï¬erence between data and simulation. â Additional background in data. Real data events typically contain more (soft) photon candidates, most of which originate from beam-related background. This background consists primarily of electrons and positrons from radiative Bhabha scattering which hit elements of the detector or the beam line, producing neutrons with energies in the MeV range, which then can produce low energy showers in the calorimeter. These additional photon candidates increase the number of Î³Î³ combinations in data, giving rise to more Ï 0 candidates, especially at low Ï 0 momentum.

305,18,0.193,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"each time we do it the initial conditions vary slightly. These slight variations can change the outcome from heads to tails and vice versa. There is no real randomness in classical mechanics, just what is often called sensitive dependence to initial conditionsâa small change in the input can get amplified and produce an entirely different outcome. The underlying idea concerning randomness in quantum mechanics is different. The randomness is true randomness. The sequence NSSNNNSS â¦ that we obtained from measuring spin in two directions is considered to be truly random, as we shall see. The sequence of coin tosses, HTTHHHTT â¦ appears random, but the classical laws of physics are deterministic and this apparent randomness would disappear if we could make our measurements with infinite accuracy. At this stage it is natural to question this. Einstein certainly did not like this interpretation, famously saying that God does not play dice. Couldnât there be a deeper theory? If we knew more information about the initial configurations of our electrons, couldnât it be the case that the final results would no longer be random but completely determined? Couldnât there be hidden variablesâonce we know the values of these variables, the apparent randomness disappears? In what follows we will present the mathematical theory in which true randomness is used. Later we will return to these questions. We will describe a clever experiment to distinguish between the hidden variable and the true randomness hypotheses. This experiment has been performed several times. The outcomes have always shown that the randomness is real and that there is no simple hidden variable theory that can eliminate it. We started this chapter by saying that a qubit can be represented by the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon. We will show how the models for spin and polarization are related. Photons and Polarization It is often said that we are not aware of the strange quantum phenomena because they only occur at incredibly small scales and are not apparent at the scales of our everyday life. There is some truth to this, but there is an experiment that is completely analogous to measuring spin of electrons that can be performed with very little apparatus. It concerns polarized light."

The resonance is observed in two-photon production, a mechanism providing a clean environment for studying resonances in direct formation (see Chapter 22 for the details), both in Î³Î³ â D0D0 and Î³Î³ â D+Dâ (see Fig. 18.2.5 (a) and (b), respectively). The final state charmed mesons are fully reconstructed. Twophoton events are separated from e+ eâ annihilation and ISR events by requiring that the transverse momentum of the DD system be small, as expected for two-photon events in the no-tag mode (i.e., where neither the outgoing electron nor the positron are detected). The resulting combined invariant mass distribution is fitted with a relativistic Breit-Wigner signal function (taking the mass resolution and reconstruction eï¬ciency into account) and a background component (Fig. 18.2.5 (c)). The statistical significance of the Z(3930) peak is 5.3 Ï. The measured mass and total width of the resonance are listed in Table 18.2.3. The systematic uncertainties are dominated by uncertainties in the D mass and the choice of the signal function lineshape. Belle performs an angular analysis to identify the spin of the observed resonance. If one defines Î¸ as the angle of a D meson relative to the beam axis in the Î³Î³ frame (equivalent to the DD frame), the cos Î¸ distribution for a scalar particle will be flat, while for a spin-2 resonance produced with helicity 2 along the incident axis, a distribution proportional to sin4 Î¸ is expected. Spin-1 is largely suppressed in two-photon events with quasi-real photons (Yang, 1950), thus this assignment is not considered. The Belle data significantly favor spin-2 over spin-0 assignment, while the production and decay mechanisms require positive parity and C-parity. The resulting quantum numbers, J P C = 2++ , suggest identifying this particle with the previously unobserved Ïc2 (2P ) charmonium state. Assuming production of a spin-2 state, Belle calculated the product of its two-photon width and the branching fraction into DD (Table 18.2.3). The systematic errors are primarily due to uncertainties in tracking and particle identification eï¬ciencies, the choice of fit lineshapes and the errors of D branching fractions."

65,106,0.19,Handbook of Ocean Wave Energy,"To understand how the ocean waves may influence the performance of a wave energy converter, it is useful to consider the temporal, directional and spectral characteristics of the ocean waves and how these may influence the relationship between the average omni-directional wave power and the average power generation. Firstly, the temporal characteristic of a wave climate is how the sea-states that make up a wave climate vary in time as illustrated in Fig. 3.7 for the signiï¬cant wave height. In general, the more consistent the wave climate is, the more attractive it becomes (for a particular average wave power) because the WEC and power generating plant can remain closest to its optimal operating conditions and thus maximise the system efï¬ciency. However, the sea-states will vary due to changes in the metrological conditions that generate the winds and associated waves. Not surprisingly, the stability of metrological conditions varies across the world so that the wave climate is more consistent in some locations than others. This variability may be primarily associated with daily, seasonal and/or annual variations in the sea-states, each of which will have a slightly different impact on the power generation and its utility. Thus, it is clear that for all locations the temporal characteristics are an important element of the wave climate, which can result in different power generations for the same average incident wave power."

In general, the nonlinear behaviour of WECs under extreme wave conditions is not properly represented in wave-to-wire tools. Therefore, combining wave-to-wire and dynamic mooring models does not allow the full capabilities of the dynamic model to be exploited. Moreover, usually most WECs need to enter a survival mode (with no energy production) in extreme wave conditions in order to avoid structural damage which, to some extent, decreases the usefulness of wave-to-wire models since their main feature is to assess the energy conversion efï¬ciency."
305,176,0.183,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"The inability to clone a qubit has many important consequences. We want to be able to back up files and send copies of files to other people. Copying is ubiquitous. Our everyday computers are based on von Neumann architecture, which is heavily based on the ability to copy. When we run a program we are always copying bits from one place to another. In quantum computing this is not possible for general qubits. So, if programmable quantum computers are designed they will not be based on our current architecture. At first, the fact that we cannot clone qubits seems like a serious drawback, but there are a couple of important comments that need to be made. Often we want to prevent copying. We want to secure our dataâwe donât want our communications to be tapped. Here, as we saw with Eve, the fact that we cannot clone qubits can be used to our advantage, preventing unwanted copies from being made. The second comment is so important it deserves its own section. Quantum Computation versus Classical Computation The qubits 0 and 1 correspond to the bits 0 and 1. If we run our quantum CNOT gate just using the qubits 0 and 1 , and not any superpositions, then the computation is exactly the same as running a classical CNOT gate with 0 and 1. The same is true of the quantum version of the Fredkin gate. Since the classical Fredkin gate is universal and the quantum Fredkin gate using just 0 and 1 is equivalent to the classical gate, we can see that a quantum circuit can calculate anything that can be calculated by a classical circuit. The no-cloning property may seem worrisome, but it doesnât restrict us from doing classical computations in any way. This is a deep result. It shows that if we compare classical and quantum computation, we shouldnât think of them as different types of computation. Quantum computation includes all of classical computation. It is the more general form of computation. The qubit is the basic unit of computation, not the bit. Now that we have seen some basic gates, we will start to connect them together to form circuits."

Hence, the charge is only renormalized by the photon vacuum polarization blob, and it is thus universal (the same factor for all fermions, independent of their charge) and not affected by QCD at 1-loop. It is true that at higher orders the photon vacuum polarization diagram is affected by QCD (for example, at 2-loops we can exchange a gluon between the quarks in the loop), but the renormalization induced by the divergent logs from the vacuum polarization diagram remain independent of the nature of the fermion to which the photon line is attached. The gluon contributions to the vertex (ZV ) and to the self-energy (Zf ) cancel, because they have exactly the same structure as in QED, and there is no gluon contribution to the photon blob at 1-loop, so that .Ës / D 0. At the 1-loop level, the diagrams relevant for the computation of R are shown in Fig. 2.13. There are virtual diagrams and also real diagrams with one additional gluon in the final state. Infrared divergences cancel between the interference term of the virtual diagrams and the absolute square of the real diagrams, according to the"

124,17,0.181,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"a single history is however typically Hausdorff. This makes good sense given indeterminism: If different possibilities exist for the same position in space-time, the corresponding possible point events may be topologically inseparable in the full indeterministic model. â¢ These topological observations are linked to the question whether BST can be viewed as a space-time theory. Earman (2008) has asked a pointed question about the tenability of BST as a space-time theory, sharply criticizing McCallâs (1994) version of BST and raising doubts about Belnapâs framework. His main challenge is to clarify the meaning of non-Hausdorffness that occurs in BST, since in space-time theories this is a highly unwelcome feature. Some recent literature, including Tomasz Placekâs contribution to this volume, has clarified the situation considerably, highlighting the difference between branching within a space-time, which indeed has unwelcome effects well known to general relativists, and the BST notion of branching histories, in which the histories are individually nonbranching space-times. The connection between BST and general relativity is only beginning to be made, and a revision of Belnapâs prior choice principle may be in order to move the two theories closer to each other. (Technically, the issue is that the prior choice principle typically leads to a violation of local Euclidicity, which is, however, presupposed even for generalized, non-Hausdorff manifolds.) Apart from Placekâs contribution, see also Sect. 6 of the contribution by Pleitz and Strobach, and MÃ¼ller (2013b). â¢ Another area of physics that may be able to interact fruitfully with the BST framework is quantum mechanics. As BST incorporates both indeterminism and spacelike separation, it seems to be especially well suited for clarifying the issue of space-like correlations in multi-particle quantum systems, pointed out in a famous"

305,241,0.178,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"can factor a product of two large primes in polynomial time. But, on the other hand, nobody has a proof that such an algorithm doesnât exist. This is where Shor enters the picture. He constructed a quantum algorithm that does factor a product of large prime numbers. The algorithm belongs to class BQP, which means that it works with bounded error in polynomial time. One thing that needs to be emphasized is that we are no longer talking about query complexity. We are not assuming that we can ask questions of an oracle. We are counting the total number of steps or, equivalently, the time needed to get from the beginning to the end of the computation. Shor is giving a concrete algorithm for each step. The fact that the algorithm belongs to BQP means that if it is implemented it becomes feasible to factor large numbers, and, more important, it means that if the quantum circuit can be actually constructed, then RSA encryption is no longer secure. Shorâs Algorithm Shorâs algorithm involves a significant amount of mathematics. We will just give a short and somewhat vague description of the quantum part. An important part of the algorithm is a gate that is called the quantum Fourier transform gate. This can be thought of as a generalization of the Hadamard gate. In fact, for one qubit the quantum Fourier transform gate is exactly H. Recall that we used a recursive formula that told us how to get from the matrix for H â nâ1 to the matrix for H â n . Similarly, we can give a recursive formula for the quantum Fourier transform matrix. The major difference between H â n and the quantum Fourier matrix is that the entries in the latter case are generally complex numbersâmore specifically, they are complex roots of unity. Recall that the entries for H â n are either 1 or â1. These are the two possible square roots of 1. When we look for fourth roots of 1 we again just get Â±1 if we are using real numbers, but we get two other roots if we use the complex numbers. In general, 1 has n complex nth roots. The quantum Fourier transform matrix on n qubits involves all the 2 n th complex roots of unity. Simonâs algorithm was based on the properties of H â n . It used interference, the amplitudes were either 1 or â1, which meant that when we added terms, the kets either canceled or reinforced one another. Shor realized that a similar idea applied to the quantum Fourier matrix, only now the amplitudes are given not just by 1 and â1, but also by all the 2 n th complex roots"
275,348,0.178,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"12.2 Compatible and Incompatible States The conjunction fallacy does not mean that people always judge the probability of a conjunction as higher than each of its conjuncts. That would indeed be counter to probability theory. Just imagine that the choice between (a) and (b) was presented without the story about Linda. Then one would expect everyone with some notion of probability to choose (a) over (b), as confirmed in [35]. But when asked the question after first hearing the story, even people schooled in statistics fall victim to the conjunction fallacy. Why is this? The question generated a host of publications with possible explanations over the last several decades (see [19] for an overview). Among the many kinds of explanations offered, two stand out in particular. One assumes that words such as âandâ and âprobabilityâ are misunderstood by the participants, or at least not understood in their formal interpretation. The other assumes a reasoning bias. A recent overview [30] concludes that the latter has the best support of the two. But this answer begs the question: if there is a reasoning bias, where does that reasoning bias originate? Indeed, we are not satisfied with just knowing there is such a bias, rather we would like to describe how that bias unfolds as a cognitive process. To do so, let us formulate the participantsâ judgements as the outcome of a decision process. The explanations in the literature almost invariably involve two competing states, one in which Linda is a bankteller, and another where she is a feminist. To most participants in the experiment these states are not compatible, and whether bias or reasoning, each can in principle tip the scale in favor of one state or the other. In order to make headway, we have to take a closer look at the notion of compatible and incompatible states. In this presentation we will formulate states in the language of quantum cognition. Especially for the reader who is not already familiar with this approach, we will first recall some concepts from quantum mechanics. One such concept is the (formal) notion of compatible and incompatible states. Incompatibility lies at the heart of Heisenbergâs famous uncertainty principle. It holds that when we are certain about a quantum particleâs momentum, we are necessarily uncertain about its position, and vice versa. Position and momentum are therefore called incompatible states. On the other hand, again given the momentum of that particle, we can still measure its kinetic energy with certainty, momentum and kinetic energy thus being compatible states."
65,305,0.176,Handbook of Ocean Wave Energy,"Wave drift forces are due to non-symmetric wave loading on bodies, to interaction between waves of different wave period and to interaction between the wave oscillation and oscillation of the body itself. These effects give a constant or low-frequent excitation of the system. This excitation may become important if the waves are large, or if its period of oscillation coincides with resonance frequencies introduced by the mooring system. In some locations, tidal and ocean currents give signiï¬cant forces on the wave energy converters. Slack-line mooring systems are usually designed to provide a positioning force to counteract the horizontal wave drift and current forces, whereas taut-line systems may additionally counteract wave-frequent excitation in one or more modes. Unless the mooring lines are used as force reference for the energy conversion, the mooring system is usually designed to give as little influence on the wave absorption process as possible. Low-frequent resonance in the mooring system may be detrimental for the lines in storm conditions or even in normal operating conditions if not properly designed. (See Chap. 7 on mooring)"

213,38,0.173,Collider Physics Within The Standard Model : a Primer,"We see that in a gauge Lagrangian, fermion kinetic terms and interactions of gauge bosons with vector and axial vector fermion currents all conserve chirality, while fermion mass terms flip chirality. For example, in QED, if an electron emits a photon, the electron chirality is unchanged. In the ultrarelativistic limit, when the electron mass can be neglected, chirality and helicity are approximately the same and we can state that the helicity of the electron is unchanged by the photon emission. In a massless gauge theory, the LH and the RH fermion components are uncoupled and can be transformed separately. If in a gauge theory the LH and RH components transform as different representations of the gauge group, one speaks of a chiral gauge theory, while if they have the same gauge transformations, one has a vector gauge theory. Thus, QED and QCD are vector gauge theories because, for each given fermion, L and R have the same electric charge and the same colour. Instead, the standard EW theory is a chiral theory, in the sense that L and R behave differently under the gauge group (so that parity and charge conjugation nonconservation are made possible in principle). Thus, mass terms for fermions (of the form N L R + h.c.) are forbidden in the EW gauge-symmetric limit. In particular, in the Minimal Standard Model (MSM), i.e., the model that only includes all observed particles plus a single Higgs doublet, all L are SU.2/ doublets, while all R are singlets."

8,307,0.17,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","technical defect, so far not functioned quite right: one has usually introduced only the few lowest mass particles in self-consistent bootstrap circles; the more stable particles one takes, the better the particle bootstrap should function, so all stable particles need to be included, after this is done there can no longer be an objection. On the lighter side, we recall that only when MÃ¼nchhausen has yanked very strongly at his hair, was he able to move, and then not only himself, but taking with him the swamp, and the Earthâthe whole world. (c) It is noteworthy that in the realm of todayâs particle physics (or High Energy Physicsâwe have seen that these two terms mean the same) no evidence is found that the existing principles of relativity and of quantum theory need to be corrected or extended in any way; even though we are in a new situation. (d) After my report, it might seem as if the end of elementary particle physics has come. However, what I have presented arises from speculative hypothesis. And even if everything were correct, we would not come to an end, but find ourselves at a new beginning: in all the above considerations only strong interactions were considered, and not in terms of particular form of forces, but only in terms of the ever-changing composition of the âelementary particles,â and we have never spoken about their individual characteristicsâtherefore our conclusions were completely independent of all these additional known particle properties. Thus we have described the average behavior, the statistical behavior. But the main focus of high energy physics is precisely on all these more detailed individual properties of the new particles and the forces acting between them. And there is the question, why these forces? In this regard we stand at a new beginning. (e) Many physicists still believe in the possibility of exploring deeper and further to ever more elementary building blocks. One must follow this line experimentally and cannot be misled by intellectually satisfying speculation into believing that the scientific question is settled. (f) I have tried to describe everything in everyday language, in words, that we physicists use, when we talk about such things at tea. To you, the reader, everything must look very mysterious, especially the claim that each âelementary particleâ in different ways has been created from all the others. Take it to be âasif-speechâ, as a blurry image of what can be formulated much more precisely with the help of mathematics or technical jargon. With this report I also, as an aside, hope I have made you understand why we high energy physicists yearn so much for the next European 300-GeV accelerator, which will now probably be built."
305,8,0.17,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"All computations involve inputting data, manipulating it according to certain rules, and then outputting the final answer. For classical computations, the bit is the basic unit of data. For quantum computations, this unit is the quantum bitâusually shortened to qubit. A classical bit corresponds to one of two alternatives. Anything that can be in exactly one of two states can represent a bit. Later we will see various examples, which include the truth or falsity of a logical statement, a switch being in the on or off position, and even the presence or absence of a billiard ball. A qubit, like a bit, includes these two alternatives, butâquite unlike a bitâit can also be in a combination of these two states. What does this mean? What exactly is a combination of two states, and what are physical objects that can represent qubits? What is the quantum computation analog to the switch? A qubit can be represented by the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon. This, though true, does not seem particularly helpful as spins of electrons and polarizations of photons are not things that most of us have knowledge about, let alone experience with. Letâs start with a basic introduction to describe spin and polarization. To do this we describe the foundational experiment performed by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach on the spin of silver atoms. In 1922, Niels Bohrâs planetary model described the current understanding of atoms. In this model an atom consisted of a positive nucleus orbited by negative electrons. These orbits were circular and were constrained to certain radii. The innermost orbit could contain at most two electrons. Once this was filled, electrons would start filling the next level, where at most eight electrons could be held. Silver atoms have 47 electrons. Two of"
311,1752,0.168,The Physics of the B Factories,"For years the most favored option has been to assume that the X has J P C = 1++ ; a Dâ0 D molecule with L = 0 would have these quantum numbers. Such a deuteron-like state, bound by pion exchange, was discussed by Tornqvist (1994), and proposed as a model of the X(3872) structure by Swanson (2004b), and many subsequent investigators. However, definitive arguments against the 2â+ assignment have been lacking. The spin-2 hypothesis has been considered implausible from early studies onwards: the 2â+ decay to Î³J/Ï is not an electric dipole transition, and so should be suppressed;110 for the charmonium state with these quantum numbers, the 1 1D2 or Î·c2 , the isospin-violating transition Î·c2 â Ï + Ï â J/Ï would be expected to have a small rate, relative to isospin-conserving Î·c2 â Ï + Ï â Î·c (Olsen, 2005). However the BABAR study of X(3872) â J/ÏÏ (del Amo Sanchez, 2010c) reported a (relatively weak) preference for J P C = 2â+ , and there has since been a renewed discussion of this possibility (e.g. Burns, Piccinini, Polosa, and Sabelli, 2010; Faccini, Pilloni, and Polosa, 2012; Hanhart, Kalashnikova, Kudryavtsev, and Nefediev, 2012). If the X(3872) has quantum numbers J P C = 2â+ , it should be produced by two-photon fusion (see Chapter 22)."
