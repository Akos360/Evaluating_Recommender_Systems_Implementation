29,221,0.247,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Connectomics of the Brain","[namely, the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and sulcus (STS)], the authors showed that, when seeded in the left posterior STS, strong correlations with the left IFG were found in adults. For children, in contrast to adults, the analysis revealed strong correlations with the contralateral temporal region. The same observation was present when the seed was in the IFG. Within the same period in which homotopic connections prevail, a 5-year longitudinal study showed a linear increase with age of the left hemisphere involvement in the IFG during verb generation (Szaflarski et al. 2006), an additional demonstration that language left-hemisphere specialization develops first through callosal interactions. As a whole, these recent functional imaging studies show that anatomical and functional asymmetries of auditory primary areas are in place at birth, whereas in high-order language areas (IFG, STS, STG) leftward asymmetries develop slowly along with verbal acquisition, before reaching the adult pattern of a dominant intrahemispheric processing of language. To our knowledge, the exact time course and the physiological underpinnings of this developmental switch from inter- to intrahemispheric functioning during language processing remain to be established. It is not known whether this type of developmental scenario is also at stake for other left-lateralized function, such as praxis (Vingerhoets et al. 2013), or for rightlateralized functions, such as spatial attention."
70,689,0.246,Optics in Our Time,"possible to produce and observe the interference of matter waves as well. A simple way to do so is to mimic Youngâs optical double-slit experiment. Practical challenges are that for interferences to be easily observable the width of the slits must be much narrower than de Broglie wavelength, and also that the slit separation should typically be of the order of that wavelength. Modern nanotechnology has solved this problem and makes it possible to fabricate a variety of combinations of holes and slits through which matter waves can propagate. For example, one can pass a beam of atoms through a large array of parallel slits. This is an atom optics analog of the diffraction gratings widely used in optics. An important and useful property of such gratings is that the interferences of the individual wavelets result in different wavelengths (colors) exiting the grating at different angles. Likewise, a nanofabricated mechanical grating can redirect an atomic beam, or even a single atom, in a direction that depends on its energy and momentum. As a result, properly designed gratings can act as mirrors or as beam splitters for atoms (. Fig. 14.6 ). One can also use light instead of nanofabricated elements to achieve that goal. In the discussion of laser cooling we mentioned that if a photon is absorbed by an atom, then its momentum must be transferred to that atom because of momentum conservation. So, if a photon propagating from left to right is absorbed, then that atom must experience a small velocity kick in that same left to right direction. If, however, the photon propagates from right to left, the velocity kick to the atom will be from right to left as well. And if the atom interacts simultaneously with two light ï¬elds, one propagating to the left and the other to the right, then it suffers both a velocity kick to the left and a velocity kick to the right. As a result the atom âgoes in both directions,â or more precisely the atomic matter wave is split into two partial waves, one propagating to the left and the other to the right. Acting together, the two light beams act as an atomic beam splitter. Much like the observation that optical interferences build up âone photon at a time,â this is his very strange. Loosely speaking, the atom can move in two directions at the same time, and be in two places at the same time. In the classical world such a behavior would be impossible: The atom would go either to the left or to the right, but not to the left and to the right."

95,345,0.24,Elements of Robotics,"Already from the middle left diagram, we see that it is not necessary to search towards the top left, because the f values of the cells above and to the left of S are higher than the values to the right of and below S. In the middle right diagram, the first sand cell has a value of 13 so the algorithm continues to expand the cells with the lower cost of 12 to the left. In the bottom left diagram, we see that the search does not continue to the lower left of the map because the cost of 16 is higher than the cost of 14 once the search leaves the sand. From that point, the goal cell G is found very quickly. As in Dijkstraâs algorithm, the shortest path is found by tracing back through cells with lower g values until the start cell is reached. Comparing Figs. 10.4 and 10.12 we see that the Aâ algorithm needed to visit only 71% of the cells visited by Dijkstraâs algorithm. Although the Aâ algorithm must perform additional work to compute the heuristic function, the reduced number of cells visited makes the algorithm more efficient. Furthermore, this heuristic function depends only on the area searched and not on the obstacles; even if the set of obstacles is changed, the heuristic function does not need to be recomputed."

This suggests that the MOC processor may enhance the lateralization of speech, and possibly spatial segregation, in situations with multiple spatially non-overlapping speakers.

128,214,0.206,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"This confirms our hypothesis that disability is not a divisive issue in political terms, whereas solidarity engagement in the other two fields is more related to political-ideological elements. Once again, the field of refugees is singled out for its specificity: here, centre-left people are by far the largest category. Finally, it is worth noting that people not self-placed on the left-right scale are under-represented in all fields, signalling again the positive linkage between political involvement and civic engagement in solidarity actions. Table 6.9 shows the relationship between the libertarian-authoritarian index and solidarity actions, too. Electoral studies have highlighted that new political issues linked to the libertarian-authoritarian dimension have become salient for voters (Thomassen 2005), besides the traditional lines of political contestation (left-right and religion). In our survey, there are several questions connected to a broader libertarian-authoritarian divide, as confirmed by a factor analysis.3 Consequently, we created an additive index linked to a unique factor component. This index is an indicator of libertarian values, and we recoded it classifying values between 0 and 4.4 as âauthoritarianâ, values between 4.6 and 5.4 as âneutralâ, and values between 5.6 and 10 as âlibertarianâ. Findings confirm that disability is not a divisive issue in political terms, whereas solidarity engagement in the unemployment field and, above all, in the refugees field is more related to political values. Indeed, in the latter field people with libertarian values are by far the largest category, whereas within the whole sample people with authoritarian values are the largest category. Focusing on voting behaviour (see Table 6.10) confirms previous analysis: a difference between centre-left and right-wing partiesâ voters emerges only among people carrying out solidarity activities in favour of refugees. Indeed, people who vote for centre-left parties (Democratic Party and radical left parties) are over-represented compared to the total population, whereas right-wing voters of Northern League are underrepresented. This is in line with our expectation. Regarding the Five Star Movement, its voters are over-represented among people engaging in solidarity actions. According to several studies, indeed, the Five Star Movement is a web-populist party (Corbetta and Gualmini 2013) appealing for direct democracy and cross-cutting the traditional left-right dimension (Maggini 2014; Tronconi 2015). This also means that among its voters there are people with left-wing values (pro-refugees) as well as right-wing people (anti-migration). The Five Star Movement is the most over-represented among people supporting the unemployed. This is"

Suppose S, â is a CSA with a single unit E, top element F, and â complements s. Suppose further that shares satisfy the disjointness property aâa = b â a = E. For the multiplicative structure, assume S, â, F is a monoid (i.e. the axioms forced by the DotDot, DotMapsTo, and DotFull rules). It is undesirable for a share model if multiplying two positive shares (e.g. the ability to read a memory cell) results in the empty permission, so we assume that when Ï1 and Ï2 are non-E then their product Ï1 â Ï2 = E. Now add left or right distributivity. We choose right distributivity (s1 â s2 ) â s3 = (s1 â s3 ) â (s2 â s3 ); the situation is mirrored with left. Let us show that we cannot have left inverses for Ï = F. We prove by contradiction: suppose Ï = F and there exists Ï â1 such that Ï â1 â Ï = F. Then Ï = F â Ï = (Ï â1 â Ï â1 ) â Ï = (Ï â1 â Ï) â (Ï â1 â Ï) = F â (Ï â1 â Ï) Let e = Ï â1 â Ï. Now Ï = F â e = (e â e) â e, which by associativity and disjointness forces e = E, which in turn forces Ï = F, a contradiction. Now suppose that instead of adding multiplicative inverses we have both left and right distributivity. First we prove (Lemma 1) that for arbitrary s â S, s â s = s â s. We calculate: (s â s) â (s â s) = s â (s â s) = s â F = s = F â s = (s â s) â s = (s â s) â (s â s) Lemma 1 follows by the cancellativity of â between the far left and the far right. Now we show (Lemma 2) that s â s = E. We calculate: F = F â F = (s â s) â (s â s) = (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) = (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) The final equality is by Lemma 1. The underlined portion implies s â s = E by disjointness. The upshot of Lemma 2, together with our requirement that the product of two positive shares be positive, is that we can have no more than the two elements E and F in our share model. Since the entire motivation for fractional share models is to allow ownership between E and F, we must choose either left or right distributivity; we choose right since we are able to prove that the Ï â² -uniformity side condition enables the bidirectional DotStar."

As a first step we show that the law of X tx , t > 0, in (3) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and thus possesses a density function. Lemma 1 Consider the JCIR process (X tx , t â¥ 0) (started from x â¥ 0) that is defined in (3). Then for any t > 0 and x â¥ 0 the law of X tx is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and thus possesses a density function p(t, x, y), y â¥ 0.

311,230,0.184,The Physics of the B Factories,"5.2 PID algorithms and multivariate methods In the most simple method, PID selectors are based on cuts applied to the most relevant variables for every particle type (e.g. E/p for electrons, the distance traveled in the return yoke for muons, the Cherenkov angle for K/Ï separation, ...). Better performance is obtained with the use of likelihood based selectors, in which the information from the various subdetectors is used to compute a set of likelihoods Lk that the measured properties of the charged track in question would be produced by a true k-particle. For an example of implementation of a selector based on likelihood ratios, see Eq. (5.2.1). Belle has always used selectors based on likelihood ratios throughout the whole life of the experiment. Cut and likelihood based selectors are very stable over the data-taking periods and do not need re-tuning to compensate for the aging of the detectors and the changes introduced by the reprocessing of the data. However, signiï¬cant improvements can be achieved by considering a larger set of variables, even some with very mild discrimination power, in the implementation of PID selectors. BABAR uses more sophisticated statistical tools such as Neural Networks (NN), Bagged Decision Trees (BDT), and Error Correcting Output Code (ECOC) algorithms, to accommodate a large number of input variables (up to 36) and the signiï¬cant correlations among them. Due to their higher sensitivity to variations in the performance of the detector, the selectors based on multivariate methods need to be re-trained on data control samples (see Section 5.3) after every major change in the reconstruction algorithms. Particularly important for BABAR, which was aï¬ected by large variations in the performance of the IFR, is the inclusion of the data taking period as"

339,133,0.182,Etiology and Morphogenesis of Congenital Heart Disease : From Gene Function and Cellular interaction To Morphology,"The determination of the left-right asymmetry starts as leftward nodal flow generated by rotational movement of monocilia in the primitive node [4, 5]. Clockwise rotation of motile cilia creates unidirectional leftward flow because the rotational axes of cilia tilt caudal direction of the embryos [6, 7]. There are two models why nodal flow is perceived by nodal and perinodal cells. One hypothesis (chemosensory model) is that the nodal flow produces a gradient of left determinant particles (node vesicular parcels) containing hedgehog proteins and nodal [8, 9], which activate downstream signaling of nodal in the left-side perinodal cells. Alternative hypothesis (mechanosensory model) is that the leftward nodal flow provokes an asymmetrical increase influx of Ca2Ã¾ ion in the sensory cilia cells through PKD2, a causative gene for human polycystic kidney disease [9, 10]. This Ca2Ã¾ influx is linked to the activation of nodal in the left-side perinodal cells, which is consequently transferred to the left LPM."

The computed uncertainty is composed by three quantities: (i) the estimated offset, (ii) the output of a predictor function, P and (iii) the output of a safety margin function, SM. The computation of synchronization uncertainty requires a right uncertainty Ur(t) and a left uncertainty Ul(t): consequently, SPS has a right predictor with a right safety margin for right uncertainty, and a left predictor with a left safety margin for left uncertainty.
